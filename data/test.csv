not.', 'This is the first set that gives us a fair evaluation of the Bayes models, and the Bayes switching model performs significantly better than its non-parametric counterpart.', 'The constituent voting and naïve Bayes techniques are equivalent because the parameters learned in the training set did not sufficiently discriminate between the three parsers.', 'Table 4 shows how much the Bayes

whether the buying company or the to-be-bought company comes first.', 'The links can solve the problem.', 'As can be seen in the example, the first two phrases have a different order of NE names from the last two, so we can determine that the last two phrases represent a reversed relation.', 'In figure 4, reverse relations are indicated by `*â\x80\x99 next to the frequency.', 'Now we have sets of phrases which share a keyword and we have links between those sets.', '3.1 Corpora.', 'For the experiments, we used four newswire corpora, the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post, The New York Times, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal, all published in 1995.', 'They contain about 200M words (25M, 110M, 40M and 19M words, respectively).', 'All the sentences have been analyzed by our chunker and NE tag- ger.', 'The procedure using the tagged sentences to discover paraphrases takes about one hour on a 2GHz Pentium 4 PC with 1GB of memory.', '3.2 Results.', 'In this subsection, we will report the results of the experiment, in terms of the number of words, phrases or clusters.', 'We will report the evaluation results in the next subsection.', 'Step 1.', 'Extract NE pair instances with contexts From the four years of newspaper corpus, we extracted 1.9 million pairs of NE instances.', 'The most frequent NE category pairs are â\x80\x9cPerson - Person (209,236), followed by â\x80\x9cCountry - Coun- tryâ\x80\x9d (95,123) and â\x80\x9cPerson - Countryâ\x80\x9d (75,509).', 'The frequency of the Company â\x80\x93 Company domain ranks 11th with 35,567 examples.', 'As lower frequency examples include noise, we set a threshold that an NE category pair should appear at least 5 times to be considered and an NE instance pair should appear at least twice to be considered.', 'This limits the number of NE category pairs to 2,000 and the number of NE pair instances to 0.63 million.', 'Step 2.', 'Find keywords for each NE pair The keywords are found for each NE category pair.', 'For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3.', 'It is natural that the larger the data in the domain, the more keywords are found.', 'In the â\x80\x9cPerson â\x80\x93 Personâ\x80\x9d domain, 618 keywords are found, and in the â\x80\x9cCountry â\x80\x93 Countryâ\x80\x9d domain, 303 keywords are found.', 'In total, for the 2,000 NE category pairs, 5,184 keywords are found.', 'Step 3.', 'Gather phrases using keywords Now, the keyword with the top TF/ITF score is selected for each phrase.', 'If a phrase does not contain any keywords, the phrase is discarded.', 'For example, out of 905 phrases in the CC- domain, 211 phrases contain keywords found in step 2.', 'In total, across all domains, we kept 13,976 phrases with keywords.', 'Step 4.', 'Link phrases based on instance pairs Using NE instance pairs as a clue, we find links between sets of phrases.', 'In the CC-domain, there are 32 sets of phrases which contain more than 2 phrases.', 'We concentrate on those sets.', 'Among these 32 sets, we found the following pairs of sets which have two or more links.', 'Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances.', 'buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.', 'We will describe the evaluation of such clusters in the next subsection.', '3.3 Evaluation Results.', 'We evaluated the results based on two metrics.', 'One is the accuracy within a set of phrases which share the same keyword; the other is the accuracy of links.', 'We picked two domains, the CC-domain and the â\x80\x9cPerson â\x80\x93 Companyâ\x80\x9d domain (PC-domain), for the evaluation, as the entire system output was too large to evaluate.', 'It is not easy to make a clear definition of â\x80\x9cparaphraseâ\x80\x9d.', 'Sometimes extracted phrases by themselves are not meaningful to consider without context, but we set the following criteria.', 'If two phrases can be used to express the same relationship within an information extraction application (â\x80\x9cscenarioâ\x80\x9d), these two phrases are paraphrases.', 'Although this is not a precise criterion, most cases we evaluated were relatively clear-cut.', 'In general, different modalities (â\x80\x9cplanned to buyâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cagreed to buyâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cboughtâ\x80\x9d) were considered to express the same relationship within an extraction setting.', 'We did have a problem classifying some modified noun phrases where the modified phrase does not represent a qualified or restricted form of the head, like â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d, as these are both represented by the keyword â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d.', 'In this specific case, as these two titles could fill the same column of an IE table, we regarded them as paraphrases for the evaluation.', 'Evaluation within a set The evaluation of paraphrases within a set of phrases which share a keyword is illustrated in Figure 4.', 'For each set, the phrases with bracketed frequencies are considered not paraphrases in the set.', ""For example, the phrase â\x80\x9c's New York-based trust unit,â\x80\x9d is not a paraphrase of the other phrases in the â\x80\x9cunitâ\x80\x9d set."", 'As you can see in the figure, the accuracy for the domain is quite high except for the â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d set, which contains various expressions representing different relationships for an IE application.', 'The accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the number of paraphrases to the total number of phrases in the set.', 'The results, along with the total number of phrases, are shown in Table 1.', 'D o m ai n # of ph ras es t o t a l p h r a s e s ac cu ra cy C C 7 o r m o r e 1 0 5 8 7 . 6 % 6 o r l e s s 1 0 6 6 7 . 0 % P C 7 o r m o r e 3 5 9 9 9 .

small sets.', 'We can make several observations on the cause of errors.', 'One is that smaller sets sometime have meaningless keywords, like â\x80\x9cstrengthâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9caddâ\x80\x9d in the CC-domain, or â\x80\x9ccompareâ\x80\x9d in the PC-domain.', 'Eight out of the thirteen errors in the high frequency phrases in the CC-domain are the phrases in â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d.', 'As can be seen in Figure 3, the phrases in the â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d set include completely different relationships, which are not paraphrases.', 'Other errors include NE tagging errors and errors due to a phrase which includes other NEs.', 'For example, in the phrase â\x80\x9cCompany-A last week purchased rival Marshalls from Company-Bâ\x80\x9d, the purchased company is Marshalls, not Company-B.', 'Also there are cases where one of the two NEs belong to a phrase outside of the relation.', 'For example, from the sentence â\x80\x9cMr.', 'Smith estimates Lotus will make a profit this quarterâ\x80¦â\x80\x9d, our system extracts â\x80\x9cSmith esti mates Lotusâ\x80\x9d as an instance.', 'Obviously â\x80\x9cLotusâ\x80\x9d is part of the following clause rather than being the object of â\x80\x9cestimatesâ\x80\x9d and the extracted instance makes no sense.', 'We will return to these issues in the discussion section.', 'Evaluation of links A link between two sets is considered correct if the majority of phrases in both sets have the same meaning, i.e. if the link indicates paraphrase.', 'All the links in the â\x80\x9cCC-domain are shown in Step 4 in subsection 3.2.', 'Out of those 15 links, 4 are errors, namely â\x80\x9cbuy - payâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cacquire - payâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cpurchase - stakeâ\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cacquisition - stakeâ\x80\x9d.', 'When a company buys another company, a paying event can occur, but these two phrases do not indicate the same event.', 'The similar explanation applies to the link to the â\x80\x9cstakeâ\x80\x9d set.', 'We checked whether the discovered links are listed in WordNet.', 'Only 2 link in the CC- domain (buy-purchase, acquire-acquisition) and 2 links (trader-dealer and head-chief) in the PC- domain are found in the

it with our method.', 'They first collect the NE instance pairs and contexts, just like our method.', 'However, the next step is clearly different.', 'They cluster NE instance pairs based on the words in the contexts using a bag- of-words method.', 'In order to create good-sized vectors for similarity calculation, they had to set a high frequency threshold, 30.', 'Because of this threshold, very few NE instance pairs could be used and hence the variety of phrases was also limited.', 'Instead, we focused on phrases and set the frequency threshold to 2, and so were able to utilize a lot of phrases while minimizing noise.', '[Hasegawa et al. 04] reported only on relation discovery, but one could easily acquire para phrases from the results.', 'The number of NE instance pairs used in their experiment is less than half of our method.', 'There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.', 'One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].', 'The availability of comparable corpora is limited, which is a significant limitation on the approach.', 'Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].', 'This approach needs a phrase as an initial seed and thus the possible relationships to be extracted are naturally limited.', 'There has also been work using a bootstrap- ping approach [Brin 98; Agichtein and Gravano 00; Ravichandran and Hovy 02].', 'The basic strategy is, for a given pair of entity types, to start with some examples, like several famous book title and author pairs; and find expressions which contains those names; then using the found expressions, find more author and book title pairs.', 'This can be repeated several times to collect a list of author / book title pairs and expressions.', 'However, those methods need initial seeds, so the relation between entities has to be known in advance.', 'This limitation is the obstacle to making the technology â\x80\x9copen domainâ\x80\x9d.', 'Keywords with more than one word In the evaluation, we explained that â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d are considered paraphrases.', 'However, it is desirable if we can separate them.', 'This problem arises because our keywords consist of only one word.', 'Sometime, multiple words are needed, like â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cprime ministerâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cpay forâ\x80\x9d (â\x80\x9cpayâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cpay forâ\x80\x9d are different senses in the CC-domain).', 'One possibility is to use n-grams based on mutual information.', 'If there is a frequent multi-word sequence in a domain, we could use it as a keyword candidate.', 'Keyword detection error Even if a keyword consists of a single word, there are words which are not desirable as keywords for a domain.', 'As was explained in the results section, â\x80\x9cstrengthâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9caddâ\x80\x9d are not desirable keywords in the CC-domain.', 'In our experiment, we set the threshold of the TF/ITF score empirically using a small development corpus; a finer adjustment of the threshold could reduce the number of such keywords.', 'Also, â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d in the CC-domain is not a desirable keyword.', 'It is a relatively frequent word in the domain, but it can be used in different extraction scenarios.', 'In this domain the major scenarios involve the things they agreed on, rather than the mere fact that they agreed.', 'â\x80\x9cAgreeâ\x80\x9d is a subject control verb, which dominates another verb whose subject is the same as that of â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d; the latter verb is generally the one of interest for extraction.', 'We have checked if there are similar verbs in other major domains, but this was the only one.', 'Using structural information As was explained in the results section, we extracted examples like â\x80\x9cSmith estimates Lotusâ\x80\x9d, from a sentence like â\x80\x9cMr.', 'Smith estimates Lotus will make profit this quarterâ\x80¦â\x80\x9d.', 'In order to solve this problem, a parse tree is needed to understand that â\x80\x9cLotusâ\x80\x9d is not the object of â\x80\x9cestimatesâ\x80\x9d.', 'Chunking is not enough to find such relationships.', 'This remains as future work.', 'Limitations There are several limitations in the methods.', 'The phrases have to be the expressions of length less than 5 chunks, appear between two NEs.', 'Also, the method of using keywords rules out phrases which donâ\x80\x99t contain popular words in the domain.', 'We are not claiming that this method is almighty.', 'Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.', 'Applications The discovered paraphrases have multiple applications.', 'One obvious application is information extraction.', 'In IE, creating the patterns which express the requested scenario, e.g. â\x80\x9cmanagement successionâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9ccorporate merger and acquisitionâ\x80\x9d is regarded as the hardest task.', 'The discovered paraphrases can be a big help to reduce human labor and create a more comprehensive pattern set.', 'Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically.', 'While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.', 'We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.', 'We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.', 'After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kind of cue.', 'In total 13,976 phrases are assigned to sets of phrases, and the accuracy on our evaluation data ranges from 65 to 99%, depending on the domain and the size of the sets.', 'The accuracies for link were 73% and 86% on two evaluated domains.', 'These results are promising and there are several avenues for improving on these results.', 'This research was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research

their relevance to the target domain, determined by both how similar to it they appear to be, and whether they belong to general language or not.', 'This extends previous work on discriminative weighting by using a finer granularity, focusing on the properties of instances rather than corpus components, and using a simpler training procedure.', 'We incorporate instance weighting into a mixture-model framework, and find that it yields consistent improvements over a wide range of baselines.', 'Domain adaptation is a common concern when optimizing empirical NLP applications.', 'Even when there is training data available in the domain of interest, there is often additional data from other domains that could in principle be used to improve performance.', 'Realizing gains in practice can be challenging, however, particularly when the target domain is distant from the background data.', 'For developers of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems, an additional complication is the heterogeneous nature of SMT components (word-alignment model, language model, translation model, etc.', '), which precludes a single universal approach to adaptation.', 'In this paper we study the problem of using a parallel corpus from a background domain (OUT) to improve performance on a target domain (IN) for which a smaller amount of parallel training material—though adequate for reasonable performance—is also available.', 'This is a standard adaptation problem for SMT.', 'It is difficult when IN and OUT are dissimilar, as they are in the cases we study.', 'For simplicity, we assume that OUT is homogeneous.', 'The techniques we develop can be extended in a relatively straightforward manner to the more general case when OUT consists of multiple sub-domains.', 'There is a fairly large body of work on SMT adaptation.', 'We introduce several new ideas.', 'First, we aim to explicitly characterize examples from OUT as belonging to general language or not.', 'Previous approaches have tried to find examples that are similar to the target domain.', 'This is less effective in our setting, where IN and OUT are disparate.', 'The idea of distinguishing between general and domain-specific examples is due to Daum´e and Marcu (2006), who used a maximum-entropy model with latent variables to capture the degree of specificity.', 'Daum´e (2007) applies a related idea in a simpler way, by splitting features into general and domain-specific versions.', 'This highly effective approach is not directly applicable to the multinomial models used for core SMT components, which have no natural method for combining split features, so we rely on an instance-weighting approach (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) to downweight domain-specific examples in OUT.', 'Within this framework, we use features intended to capture degree of generality, including the output from an SVM classifier that uses the intersection between IN and OUT as positive examples.', 'Our second contribution is to apply instance weighting at the level of phrase pairs.', 'Sentence pairs are the natural instances for SMT, but sentences often contain a mix of domain-specific and general language.', 'For instance, the sentence Similar improvements in haemoglobin levels were reported in the scientific literature for other epoetins would likely be considered domain-specific despite the presence of general phrases like were reported in.', 'Phrase-level granularity distinguishes our work from previous work by Matsoukas et al (2009), who weight sentences according to sub-corpus and genre membership.', 'Finally, we make some improvements to baseline approaches.', 'We train linear mixture models for conditional phrase pair probabilities over IN and OUT so as to maximize the likelihood of an empirical joint phrase-pair distribution extracted from a development set.', 'This is a simple and effective alternative to setting weights discriminatively to maximize a metric such as BLEU.', 'A similar maximumlikelihood approach was used by Foster and Kuhn (2007), but for language models only.', 'For comparison to information-retrieval inspired baselines, eg (L¨u et al., 2007), we select sentences from OUT using language model perplexities from IN.', 'This is a straightforward technique that is arguably better suited to the adaptation task than the standard method of treating representative IN sentences as queries, then pooling the match results.', 'The paper is structured as follows.', 'Section 2 describes our baseline techniques for SMT adaptation, and section 3 describes the instance-weighting approach.', 'Experiments are presented in section 4.', 'Section 5 covers relevant previous work on SMT adaptation, and section 6 concludes.', 'Standard SMT systems have a hierarchical parameter structure: top-level log-linear weights are used to combine a small set of complex features, interpreted as log probabilities, many of which have their own internal parameters and objectives.', 'The toplevel weights are trained to maximize a metric such as BLEU on a small development set of approximately 1000 sentence pairs.', 'Thus, provided at least this amount of IN data is available—as it is in our setting—adapting these weights is straightforward.', 'We focus here instead on adapting the two most important features: the language model (LM), which estimates the probability p(wIh) of a target word w following an ngram h; and the translation models (TM) p(slt) and p(t1s), which give the probability of source phrase s translating to target phrase t, and vice versa.', 'We do not adapt the alignment procedure for generating the phrase table from which the TM distributions are derived.', 'The natural baseline approach is to concatenate data from IN and OUT.', 'Its success depends on the two domains being relatively close, and on the OUT corpus not being so large as to overwhelm the contribution of IN.', 'When OUT is large and distinct, its contribution can be controlled by training separate IN and OUT models, and weighting their combination.', 'An easy way to achieve this is to put the domain-specific LMs and TMs into the top-level log-linear model and learn optimal weights with MERT (Och, 2003).', 'This has the potential drawback of increasing the number of features, which can make MERT less stable (Foster and Kuhn, 2009).', 'Apart from MERT difficulties, a conceptual problem with log-linear combination is that it multiplies feature probabilities, essentially forcing different features to agree on high-scoring candidates.', 'This is appropriate in cases where it is sanctioned by Bayes’ law, such as multiplying LM and TM probabilities, but for adaptation a more suitable framework is often a mixture model in which each event may be generated from some domain.', 'This leads to a linear combination of domain-specific probabilities, with weights in [0, 1], normalized to sum to 1.', 'Linear weights are difficult to incorporate into the standard MERT procedure because they are “hidden” within a top-level probability that represents the linear combination.1 Following previous work (Foster and Kuhn, 2007), we circumvent this problem by choosing weights to optimize corpus loglikelihood, which is roughly speaking the training criterion used by the LM and TM themselves.', 'For the LM, adaptive weights are set as follows: where α is a weight vector containing an element αi for each domain (just IN and OUT in our case), pi are the corresponding domain-specific models, and ˜p(w, h) is an empirical distribution from a targetlanguage training corpus—we used the IN dev set for this.', 'It is not immediately obvious how to formulate an equivalent to equation (1) for an adapted TM, because there is no well-defined objective for learning TMs from parallel corpora.', 'This has led previous workers to adopt ad hoc linear weighting schemes (Finch and Sumita, 2008; Foster and Kuhn, 2007; L¨u et al., 2007).', 'However, we note that the final conditional estimates p(s|t) from a given phrase table maximize the likelihood of joint empirical phrase pair counts over a word-aligned corpus.', 'This suggests a direct parallel to (1): where ˜p(s, t) is a joint empirical distribution extracted from the IN dev set using the standard procedure.2 An alternative form of linear combination is a maximum a posteriori (MAP) combination (Bacchiani et al., 2004).', ""For the TM, this is: where cI(s, t) is the count in the IN phrase table of pair (s, t), po(s|t) is its probability under the OUT TM, and cI(t) = &quot;s, cI(s', t)."", 'This is motivated by taking β po(s|t) to be the parameters of a Dirichlet prior on phrase probabilities, then maximizing posterior estimates p(s|t) given the IN corpus.', 'Intuitively, it places more weight on OUT when less evidence from IN is available.', 'To set β, we used the same criterion as for α, over a dev corpus: The MAP combination was used for TM probabilities only, in part due to a technical difficulty in formulating coherent counts when using standard LM smoothing techniques (Kneser and Ney, 1995).3 Motivated by information retrieval, a number of approaches choose “relevant” sentence pairs from OUT by matching individual source sentences from IN (Hildebrand et al., 2005; L¨u et al., 2007), or individual target hypotheses (Zhao et al., 2004).', 'The matching sentence pairs are then added to the IN corpus, and the system is re-trained.', 'Although matching is done at the sentence level, this information is subsequently discarded when all matches are pooled.', 'To approximate these baselines, we implemented a very simple sentence selection algorithm in which parallel sentence pairs from OUT are ranked by the perplexity of their target half according to the IN language model.', 'The number of top-ranked pairs to retain is chosen to optimize dev-set BLEU score.', 'The sentence-selection approach is crude in that it imposes a binary distinction between useful and non-useful parts of OUT.', 'Matsoukas et al (2009) generalize it by learning weights on sentence pairs that are used when estimating relative-frequency phrase-pair probabilities.', 'The weight on each sentence is a value in [0, 1] computed by a perceptron with Boolean features that indicate collection and genre membership.', 'We extend the Matsoukas et al approach in several ways.', 'First, we learn weights on individual phrase pairs rather than sentences.', 'Intuitively, as suggested by the example in the introduction, this is the right granularity to capture domain effects.', 'Second, rather than relying on a division of the corpus into manually-assigned portions, we use features intended to capture the usefulness of each phrase pair.', 'Finally, we incorporate the instance-weighting model into a general linear combination, and learn weights and mixing parameters simultaneously. where cλ(s, t) is a modified count for pair (s, t) in OUT, u(s|t) is a prior distribution, and y is a prior weight.', 'The original OUT counts co(s, t) are weighted by a logistic function wλ(s, t): To motivate weighting joint OUT counts as in (6), we begin with the “ideal” objective for setting multinomial phrase probabilities 0 = {p(s|t), dst}, which is the likelihood with respect to the true IN distribution pi(s, t).', 'Jiang and Zhai (2007)

make an iterative approximation to expected TER.', 'However, it is robust, efficient, and easy to implement.4 To perform the maximization in (7), we used the popular L-BFGS algorithm (Liu and Nocedal, 1989), which requires gradient information.', 'Dropping the conditioning on 0 for brevity, and letting ¯cλ(s, t) = cλ(s, t) + yu(s|t), and ¯cλ(t) = 4Note that the probabilities in (7) need only be evaluated over the support of ˜p(s, t), which is quite small when this distribution is derived from a dev set.', 'Maximizing (7) is thus much faster than a typical MERT run. where co(s, t) are the

plain log-linear weighting function exp(Ei Aifi(s, t)), with outputs in [0, oo].', 'We have not yet tried this.', 'An alternate approximation to (8) would be to let w,\\(s, t) directly approximate pˆI(s, t).', 'With the additional assumption that (s, t) can be restricted to the support of co(s, t), this is equivalent to a “flat” alternative to (6) in which each non-zero co(s, t) is set to

s, t), suitably normalized.5 Such an approach could be simulated by a MAP-style combination in which separate 0(t) values were maintained for each t.

a compendium of political commentary.', 'The test data was again drawn from a segment of the Europarl corpus from the fourth quarter of 2000, which is excluded from the training data.', 'Participants were also provided with two sets of 2,000 sentences of parallel text to be used for system development and tuning.', 'In addition to the Europarl test set, we also collected 29 editorials from the Project Syndicate website2, which are published in all the four languages of the shared task.', 'We aligned the texts at a sentence level across all four languages, resulting in 1064 sentence per language.', 'For statistics on this test set, refer to Figure 1.', 'The out-of-domain test set differs from the Europarl data in various ways.', 'The text type are editorials instead of speech transcripts.', 'The domain is general politics, economics and science.', 'However, it is also mostly political content (even if not focused on the internal workings of the European Union) and opinion.', 'We received submissions from 14 groups from 11 institutions, as listed in Figure 2.', 'Most of these groups follow a phrase-based statistical approach to machine translation.', 'Microsoft’s approach uses dependency trees, others use hierarchical phrase models.', 'Systran submitted their commercial rule-based system that was not tuned to the Europarl corpus.', 'About half of the participants of last year’s shared task participated again.', 'The other half was replaced by other participants, so we ended up with roughly the same number.', 'Compared to last year’s shared task, the participants represent more long-term research efforts.', 'This may be the sign of a maturing research environment.', 'While building a machine translation system is a serious undertaking, in future we hope to attract more newcomers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry as low as possible.', 'For more on the participating systems, please refer to the respective system description in the proceedings of the workshop.', 'For the automatic evaluation, we used BLEU, since it is the most established metric in the field.', 'The BLEU metric, as all currently proposed automatic metrics, is occasionally suspected to be biased towards statistical systems, especially the phrase-based systems currently in use.', 'It rewards matches of n-gram sequences, but measures only at most indirectly overall grammatical coherence.', 'The BLEU score has been shown to correlate well with human judgement, when statistical machine translation systems are compared (Doddington, 2002; Przybocki, 2004; Li, 2005).', 'However, a recent study (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), pointed out that this correlation may not always be strong.', 'They demonstrated this with the comparison of statistical systems against (a) manually post-edited MT output, and (b) a rule-based commercial system.', 'The development of automatic scoring methods is an open field of research.', 'It was our hope that this competition, which included the manual and automatic evaluation of statistical systems and one rulebased commercial system, will give further insight into the relation between automatic and manual evaluation.', 'At the very least, we are creating a data resource (the manual annotations) that may the basis of future research in evaluation metrics.', 'We computed BLEU scores for each submission with a single reference translation.', 'For each sentence, we counted how many n-grams in the system output also occurred in the reference translation.', 'By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output, we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output, which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.', 'Because of this, we retokenized and lowercased submitted output with our own tokenizer, which was also used to prepare the training and test data.', 'Confidence Interval: Since BLEU scores are not computed on the sentence level, traditional methods to compute statistical significance and confidence intervals do not apply.', 'Hence, we use the bootstrap resampling method described by Koehn (2004).', 'Following this method, we repeatedly — say, 1000 times — sample sets of sentences from the output of each system, measure their BLEU score, and use these 1000 BLEU scores as basis for estimating a confidence interval.', 'When dropping the top and bottom 2.5% the remaining BLEU scores define the range of the confidence interval.', 'Pairwise comparison: We can use the same method to assess the statistical significance of one system outperforming another.', 'If two systems’ scores are close, this may simply be a random effect in the test data.', 'To check for this, we do pairwise bootstrap resampling: Again, we repeatedly sample sets of sentences, this time from both systems, and compare their BLEU scores on these sets.', 'If one system is better in 95% of the sample sets, we conclude that its higher BLEU score is statistically significantly better.', 'The bootstrap method has been critized by Riezler and Maxwell (2005) and Collins et al. (2005), as being too optimistic in deciding for statistical significant difference between systems.', 'We are therefore applying a different method, which has been used at the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.', 'We divide up each test set into blocks of 20 sentences (100 blocks for the in-domain test set, 53 blocks for the out-of-domain test set), check for each block, if one system has a higher BLEU score than the other, and then use the sign test.', 'The sign test checks, how likely a sample of better and worse BLEU scores would have been generated by two systems of equal performance.', 'Let say, if we find one system doing better on 20 of the blocks, and worse on 80 of the blocks, is it significantly worse?', 'We check, how likely only up to k = 20 better scores out of n = 100 would have been generated by two equal systems, using the binomial distribution: If p(0..k; n, p) < 0.05, or p(0..k; n, p) > 0.95 then we have a statistically significant difference between the systems.', 'While automatic measures are an invaluable tool for the day-to-day development of machine translation systems, they are only a imperfect substitute for human assessment of translation quality, or as the acronym BLEU puts it, a bilingual evaluation understudy.', 'Many human evaluation metrics have been proposed.', 'Also, the argument has been made that machine translation performance should be evaluated via task-based evaluation metrics, i.e. how much it assists performing a useful task, such as supporting human translators or aiding the analysis of texts.', 'The main disadvantage of manual evaluation is that it is time-consuming and thus too expensive to do frequently.', 'In this shared task, we were also confronted with this problem, and since we had no funding for paying human judgements, we asked participants in the evaluation to share the burden.', 'Participants and other volunteers contributed about 180 hours of labor in the manual evaluation.', 'We asked participants to each judge 200–300 sentences in terms of fluency and adequacy, the most commonly used manual evaluation metrics.', 'We settled on contrastive evaluations of 5 system outputs for a single test sentence.', 'See Figure 3 for a screenshot of the evaluation tool.', 'Presenting the output of several system allows the human judge to make more informed judgements, contrasting the quality of the different systems.', 'The judgements tend to be done more in form of a ranking of the different systems.', 'We assumed that such a contrastive assessment would be beneficial for an evaluation that essentially pits different systems against each other.', 'While we had up to 11 submissions for a translation direction, we did decide against presenting all 11 system outputs to the human judge.', 'Our initial experimentation with the evaluation tool showed that this is often too overwhelming.', 'Making the ten judgements (2 types for 5 systems) takes on average 2 minutes.', 'Typically, judges initially spent about 3 minutes per sentence, but then accelerate with experience.', 'Judges where excluded from assessing the quality of MT systems that were submitted by their institution.', 'Sentences and systems were randomly selected and randomly shuffled for presentation.', 'We collected around 300–400 judgements per judgement type (adequacy or fluency), per system, per language pair.', 'This is less than the 694 judgements 2004 DARPA/NIST evaluation, or the 532 judgements in the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.', 'This decreases the statistical significance of our results compared to those studies.', 'The number of judgements is additionally fragmented by our breakup of sentences into in-domain and out-of-domain.', 'The human judges were presented with the following definition of adequacy and fluency, but no additional instructions:', 'Judges varied in the average score they handed out.', 'The average fluency judgement per judge ranged from 2.33 to 3.67, the average adequacy judgement ranged from 2.56 to 4.13.', 'Since different judges judged different systems (recall that judges were excluded to judge system output from their own institution), we normalized the scores.', 'The normalized judgement per judge is the raw judgement plus (3 minus average raw judgement for this judge).', 'In words, the judgements are normalized, so that the average normalized judgement per judge is 3.', 'Another way to view the judgements is that they are less quality judgements of machine translation systems per se, but rankings of machine translation systems.', 'In fact, it is very difficult to maintain consistent standards, on what (say) an adequacy judgement of 3 means even for a specific language pair.', 'The way judgements are collected, human judges tend to use the scores to rank systems against each other.', 'If one system is perfect, another has slight flaws and the third more flaws, a judge is inclined to hand out judgements of 5, 4, and 3.', 'On the other hand, when all systems produce muddled output, but one is better, and one is worse, but not completely wrong, a judge is inclined to hand out judgements of 4, 3, and 2.', 'The judgement of 4 in the first case will go to a vastly better system output than in the second case.', 'We therefore also normalized judgements on a per-sentence basis.', 'The normalized judgement per sentence is the raw judgement plus (0 minus average raw judgement for this judge on this sentence).', 'Systems that generally do better than others will receive a positive average normalizedjudgement per sentence.', 'Systems that generally do worse than others will receive a negative one.', 'One may argue with these efforts on normalization, and ultimately their value should be assessed by assessing their impact on inter-annotator agreement.', 'Given the limited number of judgements we received, we did not try to evaluate this.', 'Confidence Interval: To estimate confidence intervals for the average mean scores for the systems, we use standard significance testing.', 'Given a set of n sentences, we can compute the sample mean x� and sample variance s2 of the individual sentence judgements xi: The extend of the confidence interval [x−d, x+df can be computed by d = 1.96 ·�n (6) Pairwise Comparison: As for the automatic evaluation metric, we want to be able to rank different systems against each other, for which we need assessments of statistical significance on the differences between a pair of systems.', 'Unfortunately, we have much less data to work with than with the automatic scores.', 'The way we cant distinction between system performance.', 'Automatic scores are computed on a larger tested than manual scores (3064 sentences vs. 300–400 sentences). collected manual judgements, we do not necessarily have the same sentence judged for both systems (judges evaluate 5 systems out of the 8–10 participating systems).', 'Still, for about good number of sentences, we do have this direct comparison, which allows us to apply the sign test, as described in Section 2.2.', 'The results of the manual and automatic evaluation of the participating system translations is detailed in the figures at the end of this paper.', 'The scores and confidence intervals are detailed first in the Figures 7–10 in table form (including ranks), and then in graphical form in Figures 11–16.', 'In the graphs, system scores are indicated by a point, the confidence intervals by shaded areas around the point.', 'In all figures, we present the per-sentence normalized judgements.', 'The normalization on a per-judge basis gave very similar ranking, only slightly less consistent with the ranking from the pairwise comparisons.', 'The confidence intervals are computed by bootstrap resampling for BLEU, and by standard significance testing for the manual scores, as described earlier in the paper.', 'Pairwise comparison is done using the sign test.', 'Often, two systems can not be distinguished with a confidence of over 95%, so there are ranked the same.', 'This actually happens quite frequently (more below), so that the rankings are broad estimates.', 'For instance: if 10 systems participate, and one system does better than 3 others, worse then 2, and is not significant different from the remaining 4, its rank is in the interval 3–7.', 'At first glance, we quickly recognize that many systems are scored very similar, both in terms of manual judgement and BLEU.', 'There may be occasionally a system clearly at the top or at the bottom, but most systems are so close that it is hard to distinguish them.', 'In Figure 4, we displayed the number of system comparisons, for which we concluded statistical significance.', 'For the automatic scoring method BLEU, we can distinguish three quarters of the systems.', 'While the Bootstrap method is slightly more sensitive, it is very much in line with the sign test on text blocks.', 'For the manual scoring, we can distinguish only half of the systems, both in terms of fluency and adequacy.', 'More judgements would have enabled us to make better distinctions, but it is not clear what the upper limit is.', 'We can check, what the consequences of less manual annotation of results would have been: With half the number of manual judgements, we can distinguish about 40% of the systems, 10% less.', 'The test set included 2000 sentences from the Europarl corpus, but also 1064 sentences out-ofdomain test data.', 'Since the inclusion of out-ofdomain test data was a very late decision, the participants were not informed of this.', 'So, this was a surprise element due to practical reasons, not malice.', 'All systems (except for Systran, which was not tuned to Europarl) did considerably worse on outof-domain training data.', 'This is demonstrated by average scores over all systems, in terms of BLEU, fluency and adequacy, as displayed in Figure 5.', 'The manual scores are averages over the raw unnormalized scores.', 'It is well know that language pairs such as EnglishGerman pose more challenges to machine translation systems than language pairs such as FrenchEnglish.', 'Different sentence structure and rich target language morphology are two reasons for this.', 'Again, we can compute average scores for all systems for the different language pairs (Figure 6).', 'The differences in difficulty are better reflected in the BLEU scores than in the raw un-normalized manual judgements.', 'The easiest language pair according to BLEU (English-French: 28.33) received worse manual scores than the hardest (English-German: 14.01).', 'This is because different judges focused on different language pairs.', 'Hence, the different averages of manual scores for the different language pairs reflect the behaviour of the judges, not the quality of the systems on different language pairs.', 'Given the closeness of most systems and the wide over-lapping confidence intervals it is hard to make strong statements about the correlation between human judgements and automatic scoring methods such as BLEU.', 'We confirm the finding by Callison-Burch et al. (2006) that the rule-based system of Systran is not adequately appreciated by BLEU.', 'In-domain Systran scores on this metric are lower than all statistical systems, even the ones that have much worse human scores.', 'Surprisingly, this effect is much less obvious for out-of-domain test data.', 'For instance, for out-ofdomain English-French, Systran has the best BLEU and manual scores.', 'Our suspicion is that BLEU is very sensitive to jargon, to selecting exactly the right words, and not synonyms that human judges may appreciate as equally good.', 'This is can not be the only explanation, since the discrepancy still holds, for instance, for out-of-domain French-English, where Systran receives among the best adequacy and fluency scores, but a worse BLEU score than all but one statistical system.', 'This data set of manual judgements should provide a fruitful resource for research on better automatic scoring methods.', 'So, who won the competition?', 'The best answer to this is: many research labs have very competitive systems whose performance is hard to tell apart.', 'This is not completely surprising, since all systems use very similar technology.', 'For some language pairs (such as GermanEnglish) system performance is more divergent than for others (such as English-French), at least as measured by BLEU.', 'The statistical systems seem to still lag behind the commercial rule-based competition when translating into morphological rich languages, as demonstrated by the results for English-German and English-French.', 'The predominate focus of building systems that translate into English has ignored so far the difficult issues of generating rich morphology which may not be determined solely by local context.', 'This is the first time that we organized a large-scale manual evaluation.', 'While we used the standard metrics of the community, the we way presented translations and prompted for assessment differed from other evaluation campaigns.', 'For instance, in the recent IWSLT evaluation, first fluency annotations were solicited (while withholding the source sentence), and then adequacy annotations.', 'Almost all annotators reported difficulties in maintaining a consistent standard for fluency and adequacy judgements, but nevertheless most did not explicitly move towards a ranking-based evaluation.', 'Almost all annotators expressed their preference to move to a ranking-based evaluation in the future.', 'A few pointed out that adequacy should be broken up into two criteria: (a) are all source words covered?', '(b) does the translation have the same meaning, including connotations?', 'Annotators suggested that long sentences are almost impossible to judge.', 'Since all long sentence translation are somewhat muddled, even a contrastive evaluation between systems was difficult.', 'A few annotators suggested to break up long sentences into clauses and evaluate these separately.', 'Not every annotator was fluent in both the source and the target language.', 'While it is essential to be fluent in the target language, it is not strictly necessary to know the source language, if a reference translation was given.', 'However, ince we extracted the test corpus automatically from web sources, the reference translation was not always accurate — due to sentence alignment errors, or because translators did not adhere to a strict sentence-by-sentence translation (say, using pronouns when referring to entities mentioned in the previous sentence).', 'Lack of correct reference translations was pointed out as a short-coming of our evaluation.', 'One annotator suggested that this was the case for as much as 10% of our test sentences.', 'Annotators argued for the importance of having correct and even multiple references.', 'It was also proposed to allow annotators to skip sentences that they are unable to judge.', 'We carried out an extensive manual and automatic evaluation of machine translation performance on European language pairs.', 'While many systems had similar performance, the results offer interesting insights, especially about the relative performance of statistical and rule-based systems.', 'Due to many similarly performing systems, we are not able to draw strong conclusions on the question of correlation of manual and automatic evaluation metrics.', 'The bias of automatic methods in favor of statistical systems seems to be less pronounced on out-of-domain test data.', 'The manual evaluation of scoring translation on a graded scale from 1–5 seems to be very hard to perform.', 'Replacing this with an ranked evaluation seems to be more suitable.', 'Human judges also pointed out difficulties with the evaluation of long sentences.', 'This work was supported in part under the GALE program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Contract No.', 'HR0011-06-C-0022.']",abstractive

we use linear probing because it has less memory overhead when entries are small.', 'Linear probing places at most one entry in each bucket.', 'When a collision occurs, linear probing places the entry to be inserted in the next (higher index) empty bucket, wrapping around as necessary.', 'Therefore, a populated probing hash table consists of an array of buckets that contain either one entry or are empty.', 'Non-empty buckets contain an entry belonging to them or to a preceding bucket where a conflict occurred.', 'Searching a probing hash table consists of hashing the key, indexing the corresponding bucket, and scanning buckets until a matching key is found or an empty bucket is encountered, in which case the key does not exist in the table.', 'Linear probing hash tables must have more buckets than entries, or else an empty bucket will never be found.', 'The ratio of buckets to entries is controlled by space multiplier m > 1.', 'As the name implies, space is O(m) and linear in

phrase by the keyword.', 'We used the TF/ITF metric to identify keywords.', 'keywords Step 3 Sets of phrases based on keywords Step 4 Links between sets of phrases All the contexts collected for a given domain are gathered in a bag and the TF/ITF scores are calculated for all the words except stopwords in the bag.', 'Here, the term frequency (TF) is the frequency of a word in the bag and the inverse term frequency (ITF) is the inverse of the log of the frequency in the entire corpus.', 'Figure 3 Figure 1.', 'Overview of the method 2.2 Step by Step Algorithm.', 'In this section, we will explain the algorithm step by step with examples.', 'Because of their size, the examples (Figures 2 to 4) appear at the end of the paper.', 'shows some keywords with their scores.', 'Step 3.', 'Gather phrases using keywords Next, we select a keyword for each phrase â\x80\x93 the top-ranked word based on the TF/IDF metric.', '(If the TF/IDF score of that word is below a threshold, the phrase is discarded.)', 'We then gather all phrases with the same keyword.', 'Figure 4 shows some such phrase sets based on keywords in the CC-domain.', 'Step 4.', 'Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.', 'However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword.', 'For example, in Figure 3, we can see that the phrases in the â\x80\x9cbuyâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cacquireâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cpurchaseâ\x80\x9d sets are mostly paraphrases.', 'At this step, we will try to link those sets, and put them into a single cluster.', 'Our clue is the NE instance pairs.', 'If the same pair of NE instances is used with different phrases, these phrases are likely to be paraphrases.', 'For example, the two NEs â\x80\x9cEastern Group Plcâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cHanson Plcâ\x80\x9d have the following contexts.', 'Here, â\x80\x9cEGâ\x80\x9d represents â\x80\x9cEastern Group Plcâ\x80\x9d.', 'and â\x80\x9cHâ\x80\x9d represents â\x80\x9cHanson Plcâ\x80\x9d.', 'x EG, has agreed to be bought by H x EG, now owned by H x H to acquire EG x Hâ\x80\x99s agreement to buy EG Three of those phrases are actually paraphrases, but sometime there could be some noise; such as the second phrase above.', 'So, we set a threshold that at least two examples are required to build a link.', 'More examples are shown in Figure 5.', 'Notice that the CC-domain is a special case.', 'As the two NE categories are the same, we canâ\x80\x99t differentiate phrases with different orders of par ticipants â\x80\x93 whether the buying company or the to-be-bought company comes first.', 'The links can solve the problem.', 'As can be seen in the example, the first two phrases have a different order of NE names from the last two, so we can determine that the last two phrases represent a reversed relation.', 'In figure 4, reverse relations are indicated by `*â\x80\x99 next to the frequency.', 'Now we have sets of phrases which share a keyword and we have links between those sets.', '3.1 Corpora.', 'For the experiments, we used four newswire corpora, the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post, The New York Times, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal, all published in 1995.', 'They contain about 200M words (25M, 110M, 40M and 19M words, respectively).', 'All the sentences have been analyzed by our chunker and NE tag- ger.', 'The procedure using the tagged sentences to discover paraphrases takes about one hour on a 2GHz Pentium 4 PC with 1GB of memory.', '3.2 Results.', 'In this subsection, we will report the results of the experiment, in terms of the number of words, phrases or clusters.', 'We will report the evaluation results in the next subsection.', 'Step 1.', 'Extract NE pair instances with contexts From the four years of newspaper corpus, we extracted 1.9 million pairs of NE instances.', 'The most frequent NE category pairs are â\x80\x9cPerson - Person (209,236), followed by â\x80\x9cCountry - Coun- tryâ\x80\x9d (95,123) and â\x80\x9cPerson - Countryâ\x80\x9d (75,509).', 'The frequency of the Company â\x80\x93 Company domain ranks 11th with 35,567 examples.', 'As lower frequency examples include noise, we set a threshold that an NE category pair should appear at least 5 times to be considered and an NE instance pair should appear at least twice to be considered.', 'This limits the number of NE category pairs to 2,000 and the number of NE pair instances to 0.63 million.', 'Step 2.', 'Find keywords for each NE pair The keywords are found for each NE category pair.', 'For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3.', 'It is natural that the larger the data in the domain, the more keywords are found.', 'In the â\x80\x9cPerson â\x80\x93 Personâ\x80\x9d domain, 618 keywords are found, and in the â\x80\x9cCountry â\x80\x93 Countryâ\x80\x9d domain, 303 keywords are found.', 'In total, for the 2,000 NE category pairs, 5,184 keywords are found.', 'Step 3.', 'Gather phrases using keywords Now, the keyword with the top TF/ITF score is selected for each phrase.', 'If a phrase does not contain any keywords, the phrase is discarded.', 'For example, out of 905 phrases in the CC- domain, 211 phrases contain keywords found in step 2.', 'In total, across all domains, we kept 13,976 phrases with keywords.', 'Step 4.', 'Link phrases based on instance pairs Using NE instance pairs as a clue, we find links between sets of phrases.', 'In the CC-domain, there are 32 sets of phrases which contain more than 2 phrases.', 'We concentrate on those sets.', 'Among these 32 sets, we found the following pairs of sets which have two or more links.', 'Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances.', 'buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.', 'We will describe the evaluation of such clusters in the next subsection.', '3.3 Evaluation Results.', 'We evaluated the results based on two metrics.', 'One is the accuracy within a set of phrases which share the same keyword; the other is the accuracy of links.', 'We picked two domains, the CC-domain and the â\x80\x9cPerson â\x80\x93 Companyâ\x80\x9d domain (PC-domain), for the evaluation, as the entire system output was too large to evaluate.', 'It is not easy to make a clear definition of â\x80\x9cparaphraseâ\x80\x9d.', 'Sometimes extracted phrases by themselves are not meaningful to consider without context, but we set the following criteria.', 'If two phrases can be used to express the same relationship within an information extraction application (â\x80\x9cscenarioâ\x80\x9d), these two phrases are paraphrases.', 'Although this is not a precise criterion, most cases we evaluated were relatively clear-cut.', 'In general, different modalities (â\x80\x9cplanned to buyâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cagreed to buyâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cboughtâ\x80\x9d) were considered to express the same relationship within an extraction setting.', 'We did have a problem classifying some modified noun phrases where the modified phrase does not represent a qualified or restricted form of the head, like â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d, as these are both represented by the keyword â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d.', 'In this specific case, as these two titles could fill the same column of an IE table, we regarded them as paraphrases for the evaluation.', 'Evaluation within a set The evaluation of paraphrases within a set of phrases which share a keyword is illustrated in Figure 4.', 'For each set, the phrases with bracketed frequencies are considered not paraphrases in the set.', ""For example, the phrase â\x80\x9c's New York-based trust unit,â\x80\x9d is not a paraphrase of the other phrases in the â\x80\x9cunitâ\x80\x9d set."", 'As you can see in the figure, the accuracy for the domain is quite high except for the â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d set, which contains various expressions representing different relationships for an IE application.', 'The accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the number of paraphrases to the total number of phrases in the set.', 'The results, along with the total number of phrases, are shown in Table 1.', 'D o m ai n # of ph ras es t o t a l p h r a s e s ac cu ra cy C C 7 o r m o r e 1 0 5 8 7 . 6 % 6 o r l e s s 1 0 6 6 7 . 0 % P C 7 o r m o r e 3 5 9 9 9 . 2 % 6 o r l e s s 2 5 5 6 5 . 1 % Table 1.', 'Evaluation results within sets Table 1 shows the evaluation result based on the number of phrases in a set.', 'The larger sets are more accurate than the small sets.', 'We can make several observations on the cause of errors.', 'One is that smaller sets sometime have meaningless keywords, like â\x80\x9cstrengthâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9caddâ\x80\x9d in the CC-domain, or â\x80\x9ccompareâ\x80\x9d in the PC-domain.', 'Eight out of the thirteen errors in the high frequency phrases in the CC-domain are the phrases in â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d.', 'As can be seen in Figure 3, the phrases in the â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d set include completely different relationships, which are not paraphrases.', 'Other errors include NE tagging errors and errors due to a phrase which includes other NEs.', 'For example, in the phrase â\x80\x9cCompany-A last week purchased rival Marshalls from Company-Bâ\x80\x9d, the purchased company is Marshalls, not Company-B.', 'Also there are cases where one of the two NEs belong to a phrase outside of the relation.', 'For example, from the sentence â\x80\x9cMr.', 'Smith estimates Lotus will make a profit this quarterâ\x80¦â\x80\x9d, our system extracts â\x80\x9cSmith esti mates Lotusâ\x80\x9d as an instance.', 'Obviously â\x80\x9cLotusâ\x80\x9d is part of the following clause rather than being the object of â\x80\x9cestimatesâ\x80\x9d and the extracted instance makes no sense.', 'We will return to these issues in the discussion section.', 'Evaluation of links A link between two sets is considered correct if the majority of phrases in both sets have the same meaning, i.e. if the link indicates paraphrase.', 'All the links in the â\x80\x9cCC-domain are shown in Step 4 in subsection 3.2.', 'Out of those 15 links, 4 are errors, namely â\x80\x9cbuy - payâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cacquire - payâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cpurchase - stakeâ\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cacquisition - stakeâ\x80\x9d.', 'When a company buys another company, a paying event can occur, but these two phrases do not indicate the same event.', 'The similar explanation applies to the link to the â\x80\x9cstakeâ\x80\x9d set.', 'We checked whether the discovered links are listed in WordNet.', 'Only 2 link in the CC- domain (buy-purchase, acquire-acquisition) and 2 links (trader-dealer and head-chief) in the PC- domain are found in the same synset of Word- Net 2.1 (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/).', 'This result suggests the benefit of using the automatic discovery method.', 'D o m ai n Li n k ac cu ra cy W N c o v e r a g e C C 7 3 . 3 % 2 / 1 1 P C 8 8 . 9 % 2 / 8 Table 2.', 'Evaluation results for links', 'The work reported here is closely related to [Ha- segawa et al. 04].', 'First, we will describe their method and compare it with our method.', 'They first collect the NE instance pairs and contexts, just like our method.', 'However, the next step is clearly different.', 'They cluster NE instance pairs based on the words in the contexts using a bag- of-words method.', 'In order to create good-sized vectors for similarity calculation, they had to set a high frequency threshold, 30.', 'Because of this threshold, very few NE instance pairs could be used and hence the variety of phrases was also limited.', 'Instead, we focused on phrases and set the frequency threshold to 2, and so were able to utilize a lot of phrases while minimizing noise.', '[Hasegawa et al. 04] reported only on relation discovery, but one could easily acquire para phrases from the results.', 'The number of NE instance pairs used in their experiment is less than half of our method.', 'There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.', 'One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].', 'The availability of comparable corpora is limited, which is a significant limitation on the approach.', 'Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].', 'This approach needs a phrase as an initial seed and thus the possible relationships to be extracted are naturally limited.', 'There has also been work using a bootstrap- ping approach [Brin 98; Agichtein and Gravano 00; Ravichandran and Hovy 02].', 'The basic strategy is, for a given pair of entity types, to start with some examples, like several famous book title and author pairs; and find expressions which contains those names; then using the found expressions, find more author and book title pairs.', 'This can be repeated several times to collect a list of author / book title pairs and expressions.', 'However, those methods need initial seeds, so the relation between entities has to be known in advance.', 'This limitation is the obstacle to making the technology â\x80\x9copen domainâ\x80\x9d.', 'Keywords with more than one word In the evaluation, we explained that â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d are considered paraphrases.', 'However, it is desirable if we can separate them.', 'This problem arises because our keywords consist of only one word.', 'Sometime, multiple words are needed, like â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cprime ministerâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cpay forâ\x80\x9d (â\x80\x9cpayâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cpay forâ\x80\x9d are different senses in the CC-domain).', 'One possibility is to use n-grams based on mutual information.', 'If there is a frequent multi-word sequence in a domain, we could use it as a keyword candidate.', 'Keyword detection error Even if a keyword consists of a single word, there are words which are not desirable as keywords for a domain.', 'As was explained in the results section, â\x80\x9cstrengthâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9caddâ\x80\x9d are not desirable keywords in the CC-domain.', 'In our experiment, we set the threshold of the TF/ITF score empirically using a small development corpus; a finer adjustment of the threshold could reduce the number of such keywords.', 'Also, â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d in the CC-domain is not a desirable keyword.', 'It is a relatively frequent word in the domain, but it can be used in different extraction scenarios.', 'In this domain the major scenarios involve the things they agreed on, rather than the mere fact that they agreed.', 'â\x80\x9cAgreeâ\x80\x9d is a subject control verb, which dominates another verb whose subject is the same as that of â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d; the latter verb is generally the one of interest for extraction.', 'We have checked if there are similar verbs in other major domains, but this was the only one.', 'Using structural information As was explained in the results section, we extracted examples like â\x80\x9cSmith estimates Lotusâ\x80\x9d, from a sentence like â\x80\x9cMr.', 'Smith estimates Lotus will make profit this quarterâ\x80¦â\x80\x9d.', 'In order to solve this problem, a parse tree is needed to understand that â\x80\x9cLotusâ\x80\x9d is not the object of â\x80\x9cestimatesâ\x80\x9d.', 'Chunking is not enough to find such relationships.', 'This remains as future work.', 'Limitations There are several limitations in the methods.', 'The phrases have to be the expressions of length less than 5 chunks, appear between two NEs.', 'Also, the method of using keywords rules out phrases which donâ\x80\x99t contain popular words in the domain.', 'We are not claiming that this method is almighty.', 'Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.', 'Applications The discovered paraphrases have multiple applications.', 'One obvious application is information extraction.', 'In IE, creating the patterns which express the requested scenario, e.g. â\x80\x9cmanagement successionâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9ccorporate merger and acquisitionâ\x80\x9d is regarded as the hardest task.', 'The discovered paraphrases can be a big help to reduce human labor and create a more comprehensive pattern set.', 'Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically.', 'While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.', 'We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.', 'We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.', 'After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kind of cue.', 'In total 13,976 phrases are assigned to sets of phrases, and the accuracy on our evaluation data ranges from 65 to 99%, depending on the domain and the size of the sets.', 'The accuracies for link were 73% and 86% on two evaluated domains.', 'These results are promising and there are several avenues for improving on these results.', 'This research was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research

of automatic and manual scoring.', '• We evaluated translation from English, in addition to into English.', 'English was again paired with German, French, and Spanish.', 'We dropped, however, one of the languages, Finnish, partly to keep the number of tracks manageable, partly because we assumed that it would be hard to find enough Finnish speakers for the manual evaluation.', 'The evaluation framework for the shared task is similar to the one used in last year’s shared task.', 'Training and testing is based on the Europarl corpus.', 'Figure 1 provides some statistics about this corpus.', 'To lower the barrier of entrance to the competition, we provided a complete baseline MT system, along with data resources.', 'To summarize, we provided: The performance of the baseline system is similar to the best submissions in last year’s shared task.', 'We are currently working on a complete open source implementation of a training and decoding system, which should become available over the summer. pus, from which also the in-domain test set is taken.', 'There is twice as much language modelling data, since training data for the machine translation system is filtered against sentences of length larger than 40 words.', 'Out-of-domain test data is from the Project Syndicate web site, a compendium of political commentary.', 'The test data was again drawn from a segment of the Europarl corpus from the fourth quarter of 2000, which is excluded from the training data.', 'Participants were also provided with two sets of 2,000 sentences of parallel text to be used for system development and tuning.', 'In addition to the Europarl test set, we also collected 29 editorials from the Project Syndicate website2, which are published in all the four languages of the shared task.', 'We aligned the texts at a sentence level across all four languages, resulting in 1064 sentence per language.', 'For statistics on this test set, refer to Figure 1.', 'The out-of-domain test set differs from the Europarl data in various ways.', 'The text type are editorials instead of speech transcripts.', 'The domain is general politics, economics and science.', 'However, it is also mostly political content (even if not focused on the internal workings of the European Union) and opinion.', 'We received submissions from 14 groups from 11 institutions, as listed in Figure 2.', 'Most of these groups follow a phrase-based statistical approach to machine translation.', 'Microsoft’s approach uses dependency trees, others use hierarchical phrase models.', 'Systran submitted their commercial rule-based system that was not tuned to the Europarl corpus.', 'About half of the participants of last year’s shared task participated again.', 'The other half was replaced by other participants, so we ended up with roughly the same number.', 'Compared to last year’s shared task, the participants represent more long-term research efforts.', 'This may be the sign of a maturing research environment.', 'While building a machine translation system is a serious undertaking, in future we hope to attract more newcomers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry as low as possible.', 'For more on the participating systems, please refer to the respective system description in the proceedings of the workshop.', 'For the automatic evaluation, we used BLEU, since it is the most established metric in the field.', 'The BLEU metric, as all currently proposed automatic metrics, is occasionally suspected to be biased towards statistical systems, especially the phrase-based systems currently in use.', 'It rewards matches of n-gram sequences, but measures only at most indirectly overall grammatical coherence.', 'The BLEU score has been shown to correlate well with human judgement, when statistical machine translation systems are compared (Doddington, 2002; Przybocki, 2004; Li, 2005).', 'However, a recent study (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), pointed out that this correlation may not always be strong.', 'They demonstrated this with the comparison of statistical systems against (a) manually post-edited MT output, and (b) a rule-based commercial system.', 'The development of automatic scoring methods is an open field of research.', 'It was our hope that this competition, which included the manual and automatic evaluation of statistical systems and one rulebased commercial system, will give further insight into the relation between automatic and manual evaluation.', 'At the very least, we are creating a data resource (the manual annotations) that may the basis of future research in evaluation metrics.', 'We computed BLEU scores for each submission with a single reference translation.', 'For each sentence, we counted how many n-grams in the system output also occurred in the reference translation.', 'By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output, we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output, which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.', 'Because of this, we retokenized and lowercased submitted output with our own tokenizer, which was also used to prepare the training and test data.', 'Confidence Interval: Since BLEU scores are not computed on the sentence level, traditional methods to compute statistical significance and confidence intervals do not apply.', 'Hence, we use the bootstrap resampling method described by Koehn (2004).', 'Following this method, we repeatedly — say, 1000 times — sample sets of sentences from the output of each system, measure their BLEU score, and use these 1000 BLEU scores as basis for estimating a confidence interval.', 'When dropping the top and bottom 2.5% the remaining BLEU scores define the range of the confidence interval.', 'Pairwise comparison: We can use the same method to assess the statistical significance of one system outperforming another.', 'If two systems’ scores are close, this may simply be a random effect in the test data.', 'To check for this, we do pairwise bootstrap resampling: Again, we repeatedly sample sets of sentences, this time from both systems, and compare their BLEU scores on these sets.', 'If one system is better in 95% of the sample sets, we conclude that its higher BLEU score is statistically significantly better.', 'The bootstrap method has been critized by Riezler and Maxwell (2005) and Collins et al. (2005), as being too optimistic in deciding for statistical significant difference between systems.', 'We are therefore applying a different method, which has been used at the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.', 'We divide up each test set into blocks of 20 sentences (100 blocks for the in-domain test set, 53 blocks for the out-of-domain test set), check for each block, if one system has a higher BLEU score than the other, and then use the sign test.', 'The sign test checks, how likely a sample of better and worse BLEU scores would have been generated by two systems of equal performance.', 'Let say, if we find one system doing better on 20 of the blocks, and worse on 80 of the blocks, is it significantly worse?', 'We check, how likely only up to k = 20 better scores out of n = 100 would have been generated by two equal systems, using the binomial distribution: If p(0..k; n, p) < 0.05, or p(0..k; n, p) > 0.95 then we have a statistically significant difference between the systems.', 'While automatic measures are an invaluable tool for the day-to-day development of machine translation systems, they are only a imperfect substitute for human assessment of translation quality, or as the acronym BLEU puts it, a bilingual evaluation understudy.', 'Many human evaluation metrics have been proposed.', 'Also, the argument has been made that machine translation performance should be evaluated via task-based evaluation metrics, i.e. how much it assists performing a useful task, such as supporting human translators or aiding the analysis of texts.', 'The main disadvantage of manual evaluation is that it is time-consuming and thus too expensive to do frequently.', 'In this shared task, we were also confronted with this problem, and since we had no funding for paying human judgements, we asked participants in the evaluation to share the burden.', 'Participants and other volunteers contributed about 180 hours of labor in the manual evaluation.', 'We asked participants to each judge 200–300 sentences in terms of fluency and adequacy, the most commonly used manual evaluation metrics.', 'We settled on contrastive evaluations of 5 system outputs for a single test sentence.', 'See Figure 3 for a screenshot of the evaluation tool.', 'Presenting the output of several system allows the human judge to make more informed judgements, contrasting the quality of the different systems.', 'The judgements tend to be done more in form of a ranking of the different systems.', 'We assumed that such a contrastive assessment would be beneficial for an evaluation that essentially pits different systems against each other.', 'While we had up to 11 submissions for a translation direction, we did decide against presenting all 11 system outputs to the human judge.', 'Our initial experimentation with the evaluation tool showed that this is often too overwhelming.', 'Making the ten judgements (2 types for 5 systems) takes on average 2 minutes.', 'Typically, judges initially spent about 3 minutes per sentence, but then accelerate with experience.', 'Judges where excluded from assessing the quality of MT systems that were submitted by their institution.', 'Sentences and systems were randomly selected and randomly shuffled for presentation.', 'We collected around 300–400 judgements per judgement type (adequacy or fluency), per system, per language pair.', 'This is less than the 694 judgements 2004 DARPA/NIST evaluation, or the 532 judgements in the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.', 'This decreases the statistical significance of our results compared to those studies.', 'The number of judgements is additionally fragmented by our breakup of sentences into in-domain and out-of-domain.', 'The human judges were presented with the following definition of adequacy and fluency, but no additional instructions:', 'Judges varied in the average score they handed out.', 'The average fluency judgement per judge ranged from 2.33 to 3.67, the average adequacy judgement ranged from 2.56 to 4.13.', 'Since different judges judged different systems (recall that judges were excluded to judge system output from their own institution), we normalized the scores.', 'The normalized judgement per judge is the raw judgement plus (3 minus average raw judgement for this judge).', 'In words, the judgements are normalized, so that the average normalized judgement per judge is 3.', 'Another way to view the judgements is that they are less quality judgements of machine translation systems per se, but rankings of machine translation systems.', 'In fact, it is very difficult to maintain consistent standards, on what (say) an adequacy judgement of 3 means even for a specific language pair.', 'The way judgements are collected, human judges tend to use the scores to rank systems against each other.', 'If one system is perfect, another has slight flaws and the third more flaws, a judge is inclined to hand out judgements of 5, 4, and 3.', 'On the other hand, when all systems produce muddled output, but one is better, and one is worse, but not completely wrong, a judge is inclined to hand out judgements of 4, 3, and 2.', 'The judgement of 4 in the first case will go to a vastly better system output than in the second case.', 'We therefore also normalized judgements on a per-sentence basis.', 'The normalized judgement per sentence is the raw judgement plus (0 minus average raw judgement for this judge on this sentence).', 'Systems that generally do better than others will receive a positive average normalizedjudgement per sentence.', 'Systems that generally do worse than others will receive a negative one.', 'One may argue with these efforts on normalization, and ultimately their value should be assessed by assessing their impact on inter-annotator agreement.', 'Given the limited number of judgements we received, we did not try to evaluate this.', 'Confidence Interval: To estimate confidence intervals for the average mean scores for the systems, we use standard significance testing.', 'Given a set of n sentences, we can compute the sample mean x� and sample variance s2 of the individual sentence judgements xi: The extend of the confidence interval [x−d, x+df can be computed by d = 1.96 ·�n (6) Pairwise Comparison: As for the automatic evaluation metric, we want to be able to rank different systems against each other, for which we need assessments of statistical significance on the differences between a pair of systems.', 'Unfortunately, we have much less data to work with than with the automatic scores.', 'The way we cant distinction between system performance.', 'Automatic scores are computed on a larger tested than manual scores (3064 sentences vs. 300–400 sentences). collected manual judgements, we do not necessarily have the same sentence judged for both systems (judges evaluate 5 systems out of the 8–10 participating systems).', 'Still, for about good number of sentences, we do have this direct comparison, which allows us to apply the sign test, as described in Section 2.2.', 'The results of the manual and automatic evaluation of the participating system translations is detailed in the figures at the end of this paper.', 'The scores and confidence intervals are detailed first in the Figures 7–10 in table form (including ranks), and then in graphical form in Figures 11–16.', 'In the graphs, system scores are indicated by a point, the confidence intervals by shaded areas around the point.', 'In all figures, we present the per-sentence normalized judgements.', 'The normalization on a per-judge basis gave very similar ranking, only slightly less consistent with the ranking from the pairwise comparisons.', 'The confidence intervals are computed by bootstrap resampling for BLEU, and by standard significance testing for the manual scores, as described earlier in the paper.', 'Pairwise comparison is done using the sign test.', 'Often, two systems can not be distinguished with a confidence of over 95%, so there are ranked the same.', 'This actually happens quite frequently (more below), so that the rankings are broad estimates.', 'For instance: if 10 systems participate, and one system does better than 3 others, worse then 2, and is not significant different from the remaining 4, its rank is in the interval 3–7.', 'At first glance, we quickly recognize that many systems are scored very similar, both in terms of manual judgement and BLEU.', 'There may be occasionally a system clearly at the top or at the bottom, but most systems are so close that it is hard to distinguish them.', 'In Figure 4, we displayed the number of system comparisons, for which we concluded statistical significance.', 'For the automatic scoring method BLEU, we can distinguish three quarters of the systems.', 'While the Bootstrap method is slightly more sensitive, it is very much in line with the sign test on text blocks.', 'For the manual scoring, we can distinguish only half of the systems, both in terms of fluency and adequacy.', 'More judgements would have enabled us to make better distinctions, but it is not clear what the upper limit is.', 'We can check, what the consequences of less manual annotation of results would have been: With half the number of manual judgements, we can distinguish about 40% of the systems, 10% less.', 'The test set included 2000 sentences from the Europarl corpus, but also 1064 sentences out-ofdomain test data.', 'Since the inclusion of out-ofdomain test data was a very late decision, the participants were not informed of this.', 'So, this was a surprise element due to practical reasons, not malice.', 'All systems (except for Systran, which was not tuned to Europarl) did considerably worse on outof-domain training data.', 'This is demonstrated by average scores over all systems, in terms of BLEU, fluency and adequacy, as displayed in Figure 5.', 'The manual scores are averages over the raw unnormalized scores.', 'It is well know that language pairs such as EnglishGerman pose more challenges to machine translation systems than language pairs such as FrenchEnglish.', 'Different sentence structure and rich target language morphology are two reasons for this.', 'Again, we can compute average scores for all systems for the different language pairs (Figure 6).', 'The differences in difficulty are better reflected in the BLEU scores than in the raw un-normalized manual judgements.', 'The easiest language pair according to BLEU (English-French: 28.33) received worse manual scores than the hardest (English-German: 14.01).', 'This is because different judges focused on different language pairs.', 'Hence, the different averages of manual scores for the different language pairs

English, in addition to into English.', 'English was again paired with German, French, and Spanish.', 'We dropped, however, one of the languages, Finnish, partly to keep the number of tracks manageable, partly because we assumed that it would be hard to find enough Finnish speakers for the manual evaluation.', 'The evaluation framework for the shared task is similar to the one used in last year’s shared task.', 'Training and testing is based on the Europarl corpus.', 'Figure 1 provides some statistics about this corpus.', 'To lower the barrier of entrance to the competition, we provided a complete baseline MT system, along with data resources.', 'To summarize, we provided: The performance of the baseline system is similar to the best submissions in last year’s shared task.', 'We are currently working on a complete open source implementation of a training and decoding system, which should become available over the summer. pus, from which also the in-domain test set is taken.', 'There is twice as much language modelling data, since training data for the machine translation system is filtered against sentences of length larger than 40 words.', 'Out-of-domain test data is from the Project Syndicate web site, a compendium of political commentary.', 'The test data was again drawn from a segment of the Europarl corpus from the fourth quarter of 2000, which is excluded from the training data.', 'Participants were also provided with two sets of 2,000 sentences of parallel text to be used for system development and tuning.', 'In addition to the Europarl test set, we also collected 29 editorials from the Project Syndicate website2, which are published in all the four languages of the shared task.', 'We aligned the texts at a sentence level across all four languages, resulting in 1064 sentence per language.', 'For statistics on this test set, refer to Figure 1.', 'The out-of-domain test set differs from the Europarl data in various ways.', 'The text type are editorials instead of speech transcripts.', 'The domain is general politics, economics and science.', 'However, it is also mostly political content (even if not focused on the internal workings of the European Union) and opinion.', 'We received submissions from 14 groups from 11 institutions, as listed in Figure 2.', 'Most of these groups follow a phrase-based statistical approach to machine translation.', 'Microsoft’s approach uses dependency trees, others use hierarchical phrase models.', 'Systran submitted their commercial rule-based system that was not tuned to the Europarl corpus.', 'About half of the participants of last year’s shared task participated again.', 'The other half was replaced by other participants, so we ended up with roughly the same number.', 'Compared to last year’s shared task, the participants represent more long-term research efforts.', 'This may be the sign of a maturing research environment.', 'While building a machine translation system is a serious undertaking, in future we hope to attract more newcomers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry as low as possible.', 'For more on the participating systems, please refer to the respective system description in the proceedings of the workshop.', 'For the automatic evaluation, we used BLEU, since it is the most established metric in the field.', 'The BLEU metric, as all currently proposed automatic metrics, is occasionally suspected to be biased towards statistical systems, especially the phrase-based systems currently in use.', 'It rewards matches of n-gram sequences, but measures only at most indirectly overall grammatical coherence.', 'The BLEU score has been shown to correlate well with human judgement, when statistical machine translation systems are compared (Doddington, 2002; Przybocki, 2004; Li, 2005).', 'However, a recent study (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), pointed out that this correlation may not always be strong.', 'They demonstrated this with the comparison of statistical systems against (a) manually post-edited MT output, and (b) a rule-based commercial system.', 'The development of automatic scoring methods is an open field of research.', 'It was our hope that this competition, which included the manual and automatic evaluation of statistical systems and one rulebased commercial system, will give further insight into the relation between automatic and manual evaluation.', 'At the very least, we are creating a data resource (the manual annotations) that may the basis of future research in evaluation metrics.', 'We computed BLEU scores for each submission with a single reference translation.', 'For each sentence, we counted how many n-grams in the system output also occurred in the reference translation.', 'By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output, we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output, which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.', 'Because of this, we retokenized and lowercased submitted output with our own tokenizer, which was also used to prepare the training and test data.', 'Confidence Interval: Since BLEU scores are not computed on the sentence level, traditional methods to compute statistical significance and confidence intervals do not apply.', 'Hence, we use the bootstrap resampling method described by Koehn (2004).', 'Following this method, we repeatedly — say, 1000 times — sample sets of sentences from the output of each system, measure their BLEU score, and use these 1000 BLEU scores as basis for estimating a confidence interval.', 'When dropping the top and bottom 2.5% the remaining BLEU scores define the range of the confidence interval.', 'Pairwise comparison: We can use the same method to assess the statistical significance of one system outperforming another.', 'If two systems’ scores are close, this may simply be a random effect in the test data.', 'To check for this, we do pairwise bootstrap resampling: Again, we repeatedly sample sets of sentences, this time from both systems, and compare their BLEU scores on these sets.', 'If one system is better in 95% of the sample sets, we conclude that its higher BLEU score is statistically significantly better.', 'The bootstrap method has been critized by Riezler and Maxwell (2005) and Collins et al. (2005), as being too optimistic in deciding for statistical significant difference between systems.', 'We are therefore applying a different method, which has been used at the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.', 'We divide up each test set into blocks of 20 sentences (100 blocks for the in-domain test set, 53 blocks for the out-of-domain test set), check for each block, if one system has a higher BLEU score than the other, and then use the sign test.', 'The sign test checks, how likely a sample of better and worse BLEU scores would have been generated by two systems of equal performance.', 'Let say, if we find one system doing better on 20 of the blocks, and worse on 80 of the blocks, is it significantly worse?', 'We check, how likely only up to k = 20 better scores out of n = 100 would have been generated by two equal systems, using the binomial distribution: If p(0..k; n, p) < 0.05, or p(0..k; n, p) > 0.95 then we have a statistically significant difference between the systems.', 'While automatic measures are an invaluable tool for the day-to-day development of machine translation systems, they are only a imperfect substitute for human assessment of translation quality, or as the acronym BLEU puts it, a bilingual evaluation understudy.', 'Many human evaluation metrics have been proposed.', 'Also, the argument has been made that machine translation performance should be evaluated via task-based evaluation metrics, i.e. how much it assists performing a useful task, such as supporting human translators or aiding the analysis of texts.', 'The main disadvantage of manual evaluation is that it is time-consuming and thus too expensive to do frequently.', 'In this shared task, we were also confronted with this problem, and since we had no funding for paying human judgements, we asked participants in the evaluation to share the burden.', 'Participants and other volunteers contributed about 180 hours of labor in the manual evaluation.', 'We asked participants to each judge 200–300 sentences in terms of fluency and adequacy, the most commonly used manual evaluation metrics.', 'We settled on contrastive evaluations of 5 system outputs for a single test sentence.', 'See Figure 3 for a screenshot of the evaluation tool.', 'Presenting the output of several system allows the human judge to make more informed judgements, contrasting the quality of the different systems.', 'The judgements tend to be done more in form of a ranking of the different systems.', 'We assumed that such a contrastive assessment would be beneficial for an evaluation that essentially pits different systems against each other.', 'While we had up to 11 submissions for a translation direction, we did decide against presenting all 11 system outputs to the human judge.', 'Our initial experimentation with the evaluation tool showed that this is often too overwhelming.', 'Making the ten judgements (2 types for 5 systems) takes on average 2 minutes.', 'Typically, judges initially spent about 3 minutes per sentence, but then accelerate with experience.', 'Judges where excluded from assessing the quality of MT systems that were submitted by their institution.', 'Sentences and systems were randomly selected and randomly shuffled for presentation.', 'We collected around 300–400 judgements per judgement type (adequacy or fluency), per system, per language pair.', 'This is less than the 694 judgements 2004 DARPA/NIST evaluation, or the 532 judgements in the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.', 'This decreases the statistical significance of our results compared to those studies.', 'The number of judgements is additionally fragmented by our breakup of sentences into in-domain and out-of-domain.', 'The human judges were presented with the following definition of adequacy and fluency, but no additional instructions:', 'Judges varied in the average score they handed out.', 'The average fluency judgement per judge ranged from 2.33 to 3.67, the average adequacy judgement ranged from 2.56 to 4.13.', 'Since different judges judged different systems (recall that judges were excluded to judge system output from their own institution), we normalized the scores.', 'The normalized judgement per judge is the raw judgement plus (3 minus average raw judgement for this judge).', 'In words, the judgements are normalized, so that the average normalized judgement per judge is 3.', 'Another way to view the judgements is that they are less quality judgements of machine translation systems per se, but rankings of machine translation systems.', 'In fact, it is very difficult to maintain consistent standards, on what (say) an adequacy judgement of 3 means even for a specific language pair.', 'The way judgements are collected, human judges tend to use the scores to rank systems against each other.', 'If one system is perfect, another has slight flaws and the third more flaws, a judge is inclined to hand out judgements of 5, 4, and 3.', 'On the other hand, when all systems produce muddled output, but one is better, and one is worse, but not completely wrong, a judge is inclined to hand out judgements of 4, 3, and 2.', 'The judgement of 4 in the first case will go to a vastly better system output than in the second case.', 'We therefore also normalized judgements on a per-sentence basis.', 'The normalized judgement per sentence is the raw judgement plus (0 minus average raw judgement for this judge on this sentence).', 'Systems that generally do better than others will receive a positive average normalizedjudgement per sentence.', 'Systems that generally do worse than others will receive a negative one.', 'One may argue with these efforts on normalization, and ultimately their value should be assessed by assessing their impact on inter-annotator agreement.', 'Given the limited number of judgements we received, we did not try to evaluate this.', 'Confidence Interval: To estimate confidence intervals for the average mean scores for the systems, we use standard significance testing.', 'Given a set of n sentences, we can compute the sample mean x� and sample variance s2 of the individual sentence judgements xi: The extend of the confidence interval [x−d, x+df can be computed by d = 1.96 ·�n (6) Pairwise Comparison: As for the automatic evaluation metric, we want to be able to rank different systems against each other, for which we need assessments of statistical significance on the differences between a pair of systems.', 'Unfortunately, we have much less data to work with than with the automatic scores.', 'The way we cant distinction between system performance.', 'Automatic scores are computed on a larger tested than manual scores (3064 sentences vs. 300–400 sentences). collected manual judgements, we do not necessarily have the same sentence judged for both systems (judges evaluate 5 systems out of the 8–10 participating systems).', 'Still, for about good number of sentences, we do have this direct comparison, which allows us to apply the sign test, as described in Section 2.2.', 'The results of the manual and automatic evaluation of the participating system translations is detailed in the figures at the end of this paper.', 'The scores and confidence intervals are detailed first in the Figures 7–10 in table form (including ranks), and then in graphical form in Figures 11–16.', 'In the graphs, system scores are indicated by a point, the confidence intervals by shaded areas around the point.', 'In all figures, we present the per-sentence normalized judgements.', 'The normalization on a per-judge basis gave very similar ranking, only slightly less consistent with the ranking from the pairwise comparisons.', 'The confidence intervals are computed by bootstrap resampling for BLEU, and by standard significance testing for the manual scores, as described earlier in the paper.', 'Pairwise comparison is done using the sign test.', 'Often, two systems can not be distinguished with a confidence of over 95%, so there are ranked the same.', 'This actually happens quite frequently (more below), so that the rankings are broad estimates.', 'For instance: if 10 systems participate, and one system does better than 3 others, worse then 2, and is not significant different from the remaining 4, its rank is in the interval 3–7.', 'At first glance, we quickly recognize that many systems are scored very similar, both in terms of manual judgement and BLEU.', 'There may be occasionally a system clearly at the top or at the bottom, but most systems are so close that it is hard to distinguish them.', 'In Figure 4, we displayed the number of system comparisons, for which we concluded statistical significance.', 'For the automatic scoring method BLEU, we can distinguish three quarters of the systems.', 'While the Bootstrap method is slightly more sensitive, it is very much in line with the sign test on text blocks.', 'For the manual scoring, we can distinguish only half of the systems, both in terms of fluency and adequacy.', 'More judgements would have enabled us to make better distinctions, but it is not clear what the upper limit is.', 'We can check, what the consequences of less manual annotation of results would have been: With half the number of manual judgements, we can distinguish about 40% of the systems, 10% less.', 'The test set included 2000 sentences from the Europarl corpus, but also 1064 sentences out-ofdomain test data.', 'Since the inclusion of out-ofdomain test data was a very late decision, the participants were not informed of this.', 'So, this was a surprise element due to practical reasons, not malice.', 'All systems (except for Systran, which was not tuned to Europarl) did considerably worse on outof-domain training data.', 'This is demonstrated by average scores over all systems, in terms of BLEU, fluency and adequacy, as displayed in Figure 5.', 'The manual scores are averages over the raw unnormalized scores.', 'It is well know that language pairs such as EnglishGerman pose more challenges to machine translation systems than language pairs such as FrenchEnglish.', 'Different sentence structure and rich target language morphology are two reasons for this.', 'Again, we can compute average scores for all systems for the different language pairs (Figure 6).', 'The differences in difficulty are better reflected in the BLEU scores than in the raw un-normalized manual judgements.', 'The easiest language pair according to BLEU (English-French: 28.33) received worse manual scores than the hardest (English-German: 14.01).', 'This is because different judges focused on different language pairs.', 'Hence, the different averages of manual scores for the different language pairs reflect the behaviour of the judges, not the quality of the systems on different language pairs.', 'Given the closeness of most systems and the wide over-lapping confidence intervals it is hard to make strong statements about the correlation between human judgements and automatic scoring methods such as BLEU.', 'We confirm the finding by Callison-Burch et al. (2006) that the rule-based system of Systran is not adequately appreciated by BLEU.', 'In-domain Systran scores on this metric are lower than all statistical systems, even the ones that have much worse human scores.', 'Surprisingly, this effect is much less obvious for out-of-domain test data.', 'For instance, for out-ofdomain English-French, Systran has the best BLEU and manual scores.', 'Our suspicion is that BLEU is very sensitive to jargon, to selecting exactly the right words, and not synonyms that human judges may appreciate as equally good.', 'This is can not be the only explanation, since the discrepancy still holds, for instance, for out-of-domain French-English, where Systran receives among the best adequacy and fluency scores, but a worse BLEU score than all but one statistical system.', 'This data set of manual judgements should provide a fruitful resource for research on better automatic scoring methods.', 'So, who won the competition?', 'The best answer to this is: many research labs have very competitive systems whose performance is hard to tell apart.', 'This is not completely surprising, since all systems use very similar technology.', 'For some language pairs (such as GermanEnglish) system performance is more divergent than for others (such as English-French), at least as measured by BLEU.', 'The statistical systems seem to still lag behind the commercial rule-based competition when translating into morphological rich languages, as demonstrated by the results for English-German and English-French.', 'The predominate focus of building systems that translate into English has ignored so far the difficult issues of generating rich morphology which may not be determined solely by local context.', 'This is the first time that we organized a large-scale manual evaluation.', 'While we used the standard metrics of the community, the we way presented translations and prompted for assessment differed from other evaluation campaigns.', 'For instance, in the recent IWSLT evaluation, first fluency annotations were solicited (while withholding the source sentence), and then adequacy annotations.', 'Almost all annotators reported difficulties in maintaining a consistent standard for fluency and adequacy judgements, but nevertheless most did not explicitly move towards a ranking-based evaluation.', 'Almost all annotators expressed their preference to move to a ranking-based evaluation in the future.', 'A few pointed out that adequacy should be broken up into two criteria: (a) are all source words covered?', '(b) does the translation have the same meaning, including connotations?', 'Annotators suggested that long sentences are almost impossible to judge.', 'Since all long sentence translation are somewhat muddled, even a contrastive evaluation between systems was difficult.', 'A few annotators suggested to break up long sentences into clauses and evaluate these separately.', 'Not every annotator was fluent in both the source and the target language.', 'While it is essential to be fluent in the target language, it is not strictly necessary to know the source language, if a reference translation was given.', 'However, ince we extracted the test corpus automatically from web sources, the reference translation was not always accurate — due to sentence alignment errors, or because translators did not adhere to a strict sentence-by-sentence translation (say, using pronouns when referring to entities mentioned in the previous sentence).', 'Lack of correct reference translations was pointed out as a short-coming of our evaluation.', 'One annotator suggested that this was the case for as much as 10% of our test sentences.', 'Annotators argued for the importance of having correct and even multiple references.', 'It was also proposed to allow annotators to skip sentences that they are unable to judge.', 'We carried out an extensive manual and automatic evaluation of machine translation performance on European language pairs.', 'While many systems had similar performance, the results offer interesting insights, especially about the relative performance of statistical and rule-based systems.', 'Due to many similarly performing systems, we are not able to draw strong conclusions on the question of correlation of manual and automatic evaluation metrics.', 'The bias of automatic methods in favor of statistical systems seems to be less pronounced on out-of-domain test data.', 'The manual evaluation of scoring translation on a graded scale from 1–5 seems to be very hard to perform.', 'Replacing this with an ranked evaluation seems to be more suitable.', 'Human judges also pointed out difficulties with the evaluation of long sentences.', 'This work was supported in part under the GALE program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Contract No.', 'HR0011-06-C-0022.']",extractive

newspaper commentaries has been assembled at Potsdam University, and annotated with different linguistic information, to different degrees.', 'Two aspects of the corpus have been presented in previous papers ((Re- itter, Stede 2003) on underspecified rhetorical structure; (Stede 2003) on the perspective of knowledge-based summarization).', 'This paper, however, provides a comprehensive overview of the data collection effort and its current state.', 'At present, the â\x80\x98Potsdam Commentary Corpusâ\x80\x99 (henceforth â\x80\x98PCCâ\x80\x99 for short) consists of 170 commentaries from MaÂ¨rkische Allgemeine Zeitung, a German regional daily.', 'The choice of the genre commentary resulted from the fact that an investigation of rhetorical structure, its interaction with other aspects of discourse structure, and the prospects for its automatic derivation are the key motivations for building up the corpus.', 'Commentaries argue in favor of a specific point of view toward some political issue, often dicussing yet dismissing other points of view; therefore, they typically offer a more interesting rhetorical structure than, say, narrative text or other portions of newspapers.', 'The choice of the particular newspaper was motivated by the fact that the language used in a regional daily is somewhat simpler than that of papers read nationwide.', '(Again, the goal of also in structural features.', 'As an indication, in our core corpus, we found an average sentence length of 15.8 words and 1.8 verbs per sentence, whereas a randomly taken sample of ten

from 8 to 10 sentences.', 'For illustration, an English translation of one of the commentaries is given in Figure 1.', 'The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the different layers of annotation that have been produced or are being produced.', 'Section 3 discusses the applications that have been completed with PCC, or are under way, or are planned for the future.', 'Section 4 draws some conclusions from the present state of the effort.', 'The corpus has been annotated with six different types of information, which are characterized in the following subsections.', 'Not all the

remaining data has been annotated to different degrees, as explained below.', 'All annotations are done with specific tools and in XML; each layer has its own DTD.', 'This offers the well-known advantages for inter- changability, but it raises the question of how to query the corpus across levels of annotation.', 'We will briefly discuss this point in Section 3.1.', '2.1 Part-of-speech

corpus has just begun.', 'We follow the guidelines developed in the TIGER project (Brants et al. 2002) for syntactic annotation of German newspaper text, using the Annotate3 tool for interactive construction of tree structures.', '2.3 Rhetorical structure.', 'All commentaries have been annotated with rhetorical structure, using RSTTool4 and the definitions of discourse relations provided by Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann, Thompson 1988).', 'Two annotators received training with the RST definitions and started the process with a first set of 10 texts, the results of which were intensively discussed and revised.', 'Then, the remaining texts were annotated and cross-validated, always with discussions among the annotators.', 'Thus we opted not to take the step of creating more precise written annotation guidelines (as (Carlson, Marcu 2001) did for English), which would then allow for measuring inter-annotator agreement.', 'The motivation for our more informal approach was the intuition that there are so many open problems in rhetorical analysis (and more so for German than for English; see below) that the main task is qualitative investigation, whereas rigorous quantitative analyses should be performed at a later stage.', 'One conclusion drawn from this annotation effort was that for humans and machines alike, 2 www.sfs.nphil.unituebingen.de/Elwis/stts/

respond to this on the one hand with a format for its underspecification (see 2.4) and on the other hand with an additional level of annotation that attends only to connectives and their scopes (see 2.5), which is intended as an intermediate step on the long road towards a systematic and objective treatment of rhetorical structure.', '2.4 Underspecified rhetorical structure.', 'While RST (Mann, Thompson 1988) proposed that a single relation hold between adjacent text segments, SDRT (Asher, Lascarides 2003) maintains that multiple relations may hold simultaneously.', 'Within the RST â\x80\x9cuser communityâ\x80\x9d there has also been discussion whether two levels of discourse structure should not be systematically distinguished (intentional versus informational).', 'Some relations are signalled by subordinating conjunctions, which clearly demarcate the range of the text spans related (matrix clause, embedded clause).', 'When the signal is a coordinating conjunction, the second span is usually the clause following the conjunction; the first span is often the clause preceding it, but sometimes stretches further back.', 'When the connective is an adverbial, there is much less clarity as to the range of the spans.', 'Assigning rhetorical relations thus poses questions that can often be answered only subjectively.', 'Our annotators pointed out that very often they made almost random decisions as to what relation to choose, and where to locate the boundary of a span.', '(Carlson, Marcu 2001) responded to this situation with relatively precise (and therefore long!)', 'annotation guidelines that tell annotators what to do in case of doubt.', 'Quite often, though, these directives fulfill the goal of increasing annotator agreement without in fact settling the theoretical question; i.e., the directives are clear but not always very well motivated.', 'In (Reitter, Stede 2003) we went a different way and suggested URML5, an XML format for underspecifying rhetorical structure: a number of relations can be assigned instead of a single one, competing analyses can be represented with shared forests.', 'The rhetorical structure annotations of PCC have all been converted to URML.', 'There are still some open issues to be resolved with the format, but it represents a first step.', 'What ought to be developed now is an annotation tool that can make use of the format, allow for underspecified annotations and visualize them accordingly.', '2.5 Connectives with scopes.', 'For the â\x80\x98coreâ\x80\x99 portion of PCC, we found that on average, 35% of the coherence relations in our RST annotations are explicitly signalled by a lexical connective.6 When adding the fact that connectives are often ambiguous, one has to conclude that prospects for an automatic analysis of rhetorical structure using shallow methods (i.e., relying largely on connectives) are not bright â\x80\x94 but see Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below.', 'Still, for both human and automatic rhetorical analysis, connectives are the most important source of surface information.', 'We thus decided to pay specific attention to them and introduce an annotation layer for connectives and their scopes.', 'This was also inspired by the work on the Penn Discourse Tree Bank7 , which follows similar goals for English.', 'For effectively annotating connectives/scopes, we found that existing annotation tools were not well-suited, for two reasons: â\x80¢ Some tools are dedicated to modes of annotation (e.g., tiers), which could only quite un-intuitively be used for connectives and scopes.', 'â\x80¢ Some tools would allow for the desired annotation mode, but are so complicated (they can be used for many other purposes as well) that annotators take a long time getting used to them.', '5 â\x80\x98Underspecified Rhetorical Markup Languageâ\x80\x99 6 This confirms the figure given by (Schauer, Hahn.', 'Consequently, we implemented our own annotation tool ConAno in Java (Stede, Heintze 2004), which provides specifically the functionality needed for our purpose.', 'It reads a file with a list of German connectives, and when a text is opened for annotation, it highlights all the words that show up in this list; these will be all the potential connectives.', 'The annotator can then â\x80\x9cclick awayâ\x80\x9d those words that are here not used as connectives (such as the conjunction und (â\x80\x98andâ\x80\x99) used in lists, or many adverbials that are ambiguous between connective and discourse particle).', 'Then, moving from connective to connective, ConAno sometimes offers suggestions for its scope (using heuristics like â\x80\x98for sub- junctor, mark all words up to the next comma as the first segmentâ\x80\x99), which the annotator can accept with a mouseclick or overwrite, marking instead the correct scope with the mouse.', 'When finished, the whole material is written into an XML-structured annotation file.', '2.6 Co-reference.', 'We developed a first version of annotation guidelines for co-reference in PCC (Gross 2003), which served as basis for annotating the core corpus but have not been empirically evaluated for inter-annotator agreement yet.', 'The tool we use is MMAX8, which has been specifically designed for marking co-reference.', 'Upon identifying an anaphoric expression (currently restricted to: pronouns, prepositional adverbs, definite noun phrases), the an- notator first marks the antecedent expression (currently restricted to: various kinds of noun phrases, prepositional phrases, verb phrases, sentences) and then establishes the link between the two.', 'Links can be of two different kinds: anaphoric or bridging (definite noun phrases picking up an antecedent via world-knowledge).', 'â\x80¢ Anaphoric links: the annotator is asked to specify whether the anaphor is a repetition, partial repetition, pronoun, epithet (e.g., Andy Warhol â\x80\x93 the PopArt artist), or is-a (e.g., Andy Warhol was often hunted by photographers.', 'This fact annoyed especially his dog...).', 'â\x80¢ Bridging links: the annotator is asked to specify the type as part-whole, cause-effect (e.g., She had an accident.', 'The wounds are still healing.), entity-attribute (e.g., She 2001), who determined that in their corpus of German computer tests, 38% of relations were lexically signalled.', '7 www.cis.upenn.edu/â\x88¼pdtb/ 8 www.eml-research.de/english/Research/NLP/ Downloads had to buy a new car.', 'The price shocked her.), or same-kind (e.g., Her health insurance paid for the hospital fees, but the automobile insurance did not cover the repair.).', 'For displaying and querying the annoated text, we make use of the Annis Linguistic Database developed in our group for a large research effort (â\x80\x98Sonderforschungsbereichâ\x80\x99) revolving around 9 2.7 Information structure.', 'information structure.', 'The implementation is In a similar effort, (GÂ¨otze 2003) developed a proposal for the theory-neutral annotation of information structure (IS) â\x80\x94 a notoriously difficult area with plenty of conflicting and overlapping terminological conceptions.', 'And indeed, converging on annotation guidelines is even more difficult than it is with co-reference.', 'Like in the co-reference annotation, GÂ¨otzeâ\x80\x99s proposal has been applied by two annotators to the core corpus but it has not been systematically evaluated yet.', 'We use MMAX for this annotation as well.', 'Here, annotation proceeds in two phases: first, the domains and the units of IS are marked as such.', 'The domains are the linguistic spans that are to receive an IS-partitioning, and the units are the (smaller) spans that can play a role as a constituent of such a partitioning.', 'Among the IS-units, the referring expressions are marked as such and will in the second phase receive a label for cognitive status (active, accessible- text, accessible-situation, inferrable, inactive).', 'They are also labelled for their topicality (yes / no), and this annotation is accompanied by a confidence value assigned by the annotator (since it is a more subjective matter).', 'Finally, the focus/background partition is annotated, together with the focus question that elicits the corresponding answer.', 'Asking the annotator to also formulate the question is a way of arriving at more reproducible decisions.', 'For all these annotation taks, GÂ¨otze developed a series of questions (essentially a decision tree) designed to lead the annotator to the ap propriate judgement.', 'Having explained the various layers of annotation in PCC, we now turn to the question what all this might be good for.', 'This concerns on the one hand the basic question of retrieval, i.e. searching for information across the annotation layers (see 3.1).', 'On the other hand, we are interested in the application of rhetorical analysis or â\x80\x98discourse parsingâ\x80\x99 (3.2 and 3.3), in text generation (3.4), and in exploiting the corpus for the development of improved models of discourse structure (3.5).', 'basically complete, yet some improvements and extensions are still under way.', 'The web-based Annis imports data in a variety of XML formats and tagsets and displays it in a tier-orientedway (optionally, trees can be drawn more ele gantly in a separate window).', 'Figure 2 shows a screenshot (which is of somewhat limited value, though, as color plays a major role in signalling the different statuses of the information).', 'In the small window on the left, search queries can be entered, here one for an NP that has been annotated on the co-reference layer as bridging.', 'The portions of information in the large window can be individually clicked visible or invisible; here we have chosen to see (from top to bottom) â\x80¢ the full text, â\x80¢ the annotation values for the activated annotation set (co-reference), â\x80¢ the actual annotation tiers, and â\x80¢ the portion of text currently â\x80\x98in focusâ\x80\x99 (which also appears underlined in the full text).', 'Different annotations of the same text are mapped into the same data structure, so that search queries can be formulated across annotation levels.', 'Thus it is possible, for illustration, to look for a noun phrase (syntax tier) marked as topic (information structure tier) that is in a bridging relation (co-reference tier) to some other noun phrase.', '3.2 Stochastic rhetorical analysis.', 'In an experiment on automatic rhetorical parsing, the RST-annotations and PoS tags were used by (Reitter 2003) as a training corpus for statistical classification with Support Vector Machines.', 'Since 170 annotated texts constitute a fairly small training set, Reitter found that an overall recognition accuracy of 39% could be achieved using his method.', 'For the English RST-annotated corpus that is made available via LDC, his corresponding result is 62%.', 'Future work along these lines will incorporate other layers of annotation, in particular the syntax information.', '9 www.ling.unipotsdam.de/sfb/ Figure 2: Screenshot of Annis

2003), (Hanneforth et al. 2003), again targeting the genre of commentaries.', 'The idea is to have a pipeline of shallow-analysis modules (tagging, chunk- ing, discourse parsing based on connectives) and map the resulting underspecified rhetorical tree (see Section 2.4) into a knowledge base that may contain domain and world knowledge for enriching the representation, e.g., to resolve references that cannot be handled by shallow methods, or to hypothesize coherence relations.', 'In the rhetorical tree, nuclearity information is then used to extract a â\x80\x9ckernel treeâ\x80\x9d that supposedly represents the key information from which the summary can be generated (which in turn may involve co-reference information, as we want to avoid dangling pronouns in a summary).', 'Thus we are interested not in extraction, but actual generation from representations that may be developed to different degrees of granularity.', 'In order to evaluate and advance this approach, it helps to feed into the knowledge base data that is already enriched with some of the desired information â\x80\x94 as in PCC.', 'That is, we can use the discourse parser on PCC texts, emulating for instance a â\x80\x9cco-reference oracleâ\x80\x9d that adds the information from our co-reference annotations.', 'The knowledge base then can be tested for its relation-inference capabilities on the basis of full-blown co-reference information.', 'Conversely, we can use the full rhetorical tree from the annotations and tune the co-reference module.', 'The general idea for the knowledge- based part is to have the system use as much information as it can find at its disposal to produce a target representation as specific as possible and as underspecified as necessary.', 'For developing these mechanisms, the possibility to feed in hand-annotated information is very useful.', '3.4 Salience-based text generation.', 'Text generation, or at least the two phases of text planning and sentence planning, is a process driven partly by well-motivated choices (e.g., use this lexeme X rather than that more colloquial near-synonym Y ) and partly by con tation like that of PCC can be exploited to look for correlations in particular between syntactic structure, choice of referring expressions, and sentence-internal information structure.', 'A different but supplementary perspective on discourse-based information structure is taken 11ventionalized patterns (e.g., order of informa by one of our partner projects, which is inter tion in news reports).', 'And then there are decisions that systems typically hard-wire, because the linguistic motivation for making them is not well understood yet.', 'Preferences for constituent order (especially in languages with relatively free word order) often belong to this group.', 'Trying to integrate constituent ordering and choice of referring expressions, (Chiarcos 2003) developed a numerical model of salience propagation that captures various factors of authorâ\x80\x99s intentions and of information structure for ordering sentences as well as smaller constituents, and picking appropriate referring expressions.10 Chiarcos used the PCC annotations of co-reference and information structure to compute his numerical models for salience projection across the generated texts.', '3.5 Improved models of discourse.', 'structure Besides the applications just sketched, the over- arching goal of developing the PCC is to build up an empirical basis for investigating phenomena of discourse structure.', 'One key issue here is to seek a discourse-based model of information structure.', 'Since DaneË\x87sâ\x80\x99 proposals of â\x80\x98thematic development patternsâ\x80\x99, a few suggestions have been made as to the existence of a level of discourse structure that would predict the information structure of sentences within texts.', '(Hartmann 1984), for example, used the term Reliefgebung to characterize the distibution of main and minor information in texts (similar to the notion of nuclearity in RST).', '(Brandt 1996) extended these ideas toward a conception of kommunikative Gewichtung (â\x80\x98communicative-weight assignmentâ\x80\x99).', 'A different notion of information structure, is used in work such as that of (?), who tried to characterize felicitous constituent ordering (theme choice, in particular) that leads to texts presenting information in a natural, â\x80\x9cflowingâ\x80\x9d way rather than with abrupt shifts of attention.', 'â\x80\x94ested in correlations between prosody and dis course structure.', 'A number of PCC commentaries will be read by professional news speakers and prosodic features be annotated, so that the various annotation layers can be set into correspondence with intonation patterns.', 'In focus is in particular the correlation with rhetorical structure, i.e., the question whether specific rhetorical relations â\x80\x94 or groups of relations in particular configurations â\x80\x94 are signalled by speakers with prosodic means.', 'Besides information structure, the second main goal is to enhance current models of rhetorical structure.', 'As already pointed out in Section 2.4, current theories diverge not only on the number and definition of relations but also on apects of structure, i.e., whether a tree is sufficient as a representational device or general graphs are required (and if so, whether any restrictions can be placed on these graphâ\x80\x99s structures â\x80\x94 cf.', '(Webber et al., 2003)).', 'Again, the idea is that having a picture of syntax, co-reference, and sentence-internal information structure at oneâ\x80\x99s disposal should aid in finding models of discourse structure that are more explanatory and can be empirically supported.', 'The PCC is not the result of a funded project.', 'Instead, the designs of the various annotation layers and the actual annotation work are results of a series of diploma theses, of studentsâ\x80\x99 work in course projects, and to some extent of paid assistentships.', 'This means that the PCC cannot grow particularly quickly.', 'After the first step towards breadth had been taken with the PoS-tagging, RST annotation, and URML conversion of the entire corpus of 170 texts12 , emphasis shifted towards depth.', 'Hence we decided to select ten commentaries to form a

from the emergence of standard formats and tag sets, which could lead to sharable resources of larger size.', 'Clearly this poses a number of research challenges, though, such as the applicability of tag sets across different languages.', 'Nonetheless, the prospect of a network of annotated discourse resources seems particularly promising if not only a single annotation layer is used but a whole variety of them, so that a systematic search for correlations between them becomes possible, which in turn can lead to more explanatory models of discourse structure.']",abstractive

features, semantic agreement, and positional information.', 'The focus of our work is on the use of contextual role knowledge for coreference resolution.', 'A contextual role represents the role that a noun phrase plays in an event or relationship.', 'Our work is motivated by the observation that contextual roles can be critically important in determining the referent of a noun phrase.', 'Consider the following sentences: (a) Jose Maria Martinez, Roberto Lisandy, and Dino Rossy, who were staying at a Tecun Uman hotel, were kidnapped by armed men who took them to an unknown place.', '(b) After they were released...', '(c) After they blindfolded the men...', 'In (b) â\x80\x9ctheyâ\x80\x9d refers to the kidnapping victims, but in (c) â\x80\x9ctheyâ\x80\x9d refers to the armed men.', 'The role that each noun phrase plays in the kidnapping event is key to distinguishing these cases.', 'The correct resolution in sentence (b) comes from knowledge that people who are kidnapped are often subsequently released.', 'The correct resolution in sentence (c) depends on knowledge that kidnappers frequently blindfold their victims.', 'We have developed a coreference resolver called BABAR that uses contextual role knowledge to make coreference decisions.', 'BABAR employs information extraction techniques to represent and learn role relationships.', 'Each pattern represents the role that a noun phrase plays in the surrounding context.', 'BABAR uses unsupervised learning to acquire this knowledge from plain text without the need for annotated training data.', 'Training examples are generated automatically by identifying noun phrases that can be easily resolved with their antecedents using lexical and syntactic heuristics.', 'BABAR then computes statistics over the training examples measuring the frequency with which extraction patterns and noun phrases co-occur in coreference resolutions.', 'In this paper, Section 2 begins by explaining how contextual role knowledge is represented and learned.', 'Section 3 describes the complete coreference resolution model, which uses the contextual role knowledge as well as more traditional coreference features.', 'Our coreference

MUC4 terrorism corpus, and Reuters texts about natural disasters.', 'Our results show that BABAR achieves good performance in both domains, and that the contextual role knowledge improves performance, especially on pronouns.', 'Finally, Section 5 explains how BABAR relates to previous work, and Section 6 summarizes our conclusions.', 'In this section, we describe how contextual role knowledge is represented and learned.', 'Section 2.1 describes how BABAR generates training examples to use in the learning process.', 'We refer to this process as Reliable Case Resolution because it involves finding cases of anaphora that can be easily resolved with their antecedents.', 'Section 2.2 then describes our representation for contextual roles and four types of contextual role knowledge that are learned from the training examples.', '2.1 Reliable Case Resolutions.', 'The first step in the learning process is to generate training examples consisting of anaphor/antecedent resolutions.', 'BABAR uses two methods to identify anaphors that can be easily and reliably resolved with their antecedent: lexical seeding and syntactic seeding.', '2.1.1 Lexical Seeding It is generally not safe to assume that multiple occurrences of a noun phrase refer to the same entity.', 'For example, the company may refer to Company X in one paragraph and Company Y in another.', 'However, lexically similar NPs usually refer to the same entity in two cases: proper names and existential noun phrases.', 'BABAR uses a named entity recognizer to identify proper names that refer to people and companies.', 'Proper names are assumed to be coreferent if they match exactly, or if they closely match based on a few heuristics.', 'For example, a personâ\x80\x99s full name will match with just their last name (e.g., â\x80\x9cGeorge Bushâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cBushâ\x80\x9d), and a company name will match with and without a corporate suffix (e.g., â\x80\x9cIBM Corp.â\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cIBMâ\x80\x9d).', 'Proper names that match are resolved with each other.', 'The second case involves existential noun phrases (Allen, 1995), which are noun phrases that uniquely specify an object or concept and therefore do not need a prior referent in the discourse.', 'In previous work (Bean and Riloff, 1999), we developed an unsupervised learning algorithm that automatically recognizes definite NPs that are existential without syntactic modification because their meaning is universally understood.', 'For example, a story can mention â\x80\x9cthe FBIâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cthe White Houseâ\x80\x9d, or â\x80\x9cthe weatherâ\x80\x9d without any prior referent in the story.', 'Although these existential NPs do not need a prior referent, they may occur multiple times in a document.', 'By definition, each existential NP uniquely specifies an object or concept, so we can infer that all instances of the same existential NP are coreferent (e.g., â\x80\x9cthe FBIâ\x80\x9d always refers to the same entity).', 'Using this heuristic, BABAR identifies existential definite NPs in the training corpus using our previous learning algorithm (Bean and Riloff, 1999) and resolves all occurrences of the same existential NP with each another.1 2.1.2 Syntactic Seeding BABAR also uses syntactic heuristics to identify anaphors and antecedents that can be easily resolved.', 'Table 1 briefly describes the seven syntactic heuristics used by BABAR to resolve noun phrases.', 'Words and punctuation that appear in brackets are considered optional.', 'The anaphor and antecedent appear in boldface.', '1.', 'Reflexive pronouns with only 1 NP in scope..', 'Ex: The regime gives itself the right...', '2.', 'Relative pronouns with only 1 NP in scope..', 'Ex: The brigade, which attacked ...', 'Ex: Mr. Cristiani is the president ...', 'Ex: The government said it ...', 'Ex: He was found in San Jose, where ...', 'Ex: Mr. Cristiani, president of the country ...', 'Ex: Mr. Bush disclosed the policy by reading it...', 'Table 1: Syntactic Seeding Heuristics BABARâ\x80\x99s reliable case resolution heuristics produced a substantial set of anaphor/antecedent resolutions that will be the training data used to learn contextual role knowledge.', 'For terrorism, BABAR generated 5,078 resolutions: 2,386 from lexical seeding and 2,692 from syntactic seeding.', 'For natural disasters, BABAR generated 20,479 resolutions: 11,652 from lexical seeding and 8,827 from syntactic seeding.', '2.2 Contextual Role Knowledge.', 'Our representation of contextual roles is based on information extraction patterns that are converted into simple caseframes.', 'First, we describe how the caseframes are represented and learned.', 'Next, we describe four contextual role knowledge sources that are created from the training examples and the caseframes.', '2.2.1 The Caseframe Representation Information extraction (IE) systems use extraction patterns to identify noun phrases that play a specific role in 1 Our implementation only resolves NPs that occur in the same document, but in retrospect, one could probably resolve instances of the same existential NP in different documents too.', 'an event.', 'For IE, the system must be able to distinguish between semantically similar noun phrases that play different roles in an event.', 'For example, management succession systems must distinguish between a person who is fired and a person who is hired.', 'Terrorism systems must distinguish between people who perpetrate a crime and people who are victims of a crime.', 'We applied the AutoSlog system (Riloff, 1996) to our unannotated training texts to generate a set of extraction patterns for each domain.', 'Each extraction pattern represents a linguistic expression and a syntactic position indicating where a role filler can be found.', 'For example, kidnapping victims should be extracted from the subject of the verb â\x80\x9ckidnappedâ\x80\x9d when it occurs in the passive voice (the shorthand representation of this pattern would be â\x80\x9c<subject> were kidnappedâ\x80\x9d).', 'The types of patterns produced by AutoSlog are outlined in (Riloff, 1996).', 'Ideally weâ\x80\x99d like to know the thematic role of each extracted noun phrase, but AutoSlog does not generate thematic roles.', 'As a (crude) approximation, we normalize the extraction patterns with respect to active and passive voice and label those extractions as agents or patients.', 'For example, the passive voice pattern â\x80\x9c<subject> were kidnappedâ\x80\x9d and the active voice pattern â\x80\x9ckidnapped <direct object>â\x80\x9d are merged into a single normalized pattern â\x80\x9ckidnapped <patient>â\x80\x9d.2 For the sake of sim plicity, we will refer to these normalized extraction patterns as caseframes.3 These caseframes can capture two types of contextual role information: (1) thematic roles corresponding to events (e.g, â\x80\x9c<agent> kidnappedâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9ckidnapped <patient>â\x80\x9d), and (2) predicate-argument relations associated with both verbs and nouns (e.g., â\x80\x9ckidnapped for <np>â\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cvehicle with <np>â\x80\x9d).', 'We generate these caseframes automatically by running AutoSlog over the training corpus exhaustively so that it literally generates a pattern to extract every noun phrase in the corpus.', 'The learned patterns are then normalized and applied to the corpus.', 'This process produces a large set of caseframes coupled with a list of the noun phrases that they extracted.', 'The contextual role knowledge that BABAR uses for coreference resolution is derived from this caseframe data.', '2.2.2 The Caseframe Network The first type of contextual role knowledge that BABAR learns is the Caseframe

performed syntactically without semantics, so the agent and patient roles are not guaranteed to hold, but they usually do in practice.', '3 These are not full case frames in the traditional sense, but

kidnappedâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9c<patient> abductedâ\x80\x9d) or related events (e.g., â\x80\x9c<patient> kidnappedâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9c<patient> releasedâ\x80\x9d).', 'We do not attempt to identify

used by the CFLex knowledge source.', 'For each case- frame, BABAR collects the head nouns of noun phrases that were extracted by the caseframe in the training corpus.', 'For each resolution in the

all the noun phrases, and looked up each head noun in WordNet (Miller, 1990).', 'We tagged each noun with the top-level semantic classes assigned to it in Word- Net.', 'Second, we identified the 100 most frequent nouns in the training corpus and manually labeled them with semantic tags.', 'This step ensures that the most frequent terms for each domain are labeled (in case some of them are not in WordNet) and labeled with the sense most appropriate for the domain.', 'Initially, we planned to compare the semantic classes of an anaphor and a candidate and infer that they might be coreferent if their semantic classes intersected.', 'However, using the top-level semantic classes of WordNet proved to be problematic because the class distinctions are too coarse.', 'For example, both a chair and a truck would be labeled as artifacts, but this does not at all suggest that they are coreferent.', 'So we decided to use semantic class information only to rule out candidates.', 'If two nouns have mutually exclusive semantic classes, then they cannot be coreferent.', 'This solution also obviates the need to perform word sense disambiguation.', 'Each word is simply tagged with the semantic classes corresponding to all of its senses.', 'If these sets do not overlap, then the words cannot be coreferent.', 'The semantic caseframe expectations are used in two ways.', 'One knowledge source, called WordSemCFSem, is analogous to CFLex: it checks whether the anaphor and candidate antecedent are substitutable for one another, but based on their semantic classes instead of the words themselves.', 'Given an anaphor and candidate, BABAR checks (1) whether the semantic classes of the anaphor intersect with the semantic expectations of the caseframe that extracts the candidate, and (2) whether the semantic classes of the candidate intersect with the semantic ex pectations of the caseframe that extracts the anaphor.', 'If one of these checks fails then this knowledge source

noun phrases.', 'In this case, this knowledge source reports that the candidate is not a viable antecedent for the anaphor.', '2.3 Assigning Evidence Values.', 'Contextual role knowledge provides evidence as to whether a candidate is a plausible antecedent for an anaphor.', 'The two knowledge sources that use semantic expectations, WordSemCFSem and CFSemCFSem, always return values of -1 or 0.', '-1 means that an NP should be ruled out as a possible antecedent, and 0 means that the knowledge source remains neutral (i.e., it has no reason to believe that they cannot be coreferent).', 'The CFLex and CFNet knowledge sources provide positive evidence that a candidate NP and anaphor might be coreferent.', 'They return a value in the range [0,1], where 0 indicates neutrality and 1 indicates the strongest belief that the candidate and anaphor are coreferent.', 'BABAR uses the log-likelihood statistic (Dunning, 1993) to evaluate the strength of a co-occurrence relationship.', 'For each co-occurrence relation (noun/caseframe for CFLex, and caseframe/caseframe for CFNet), BABAR computes its log-likelihood value and looks it up in the Ï\x872 table to obtain a confidence level.', 'The confidence level is then used as the belief value for the knowledge source.', 'For example, if CFLex determines that the log- likelihood statistic for the co-occurrence of a particular noun and

similar to that of (Cohen and Smith, 2007), and models using it are denoted nohsp, Parser and Grammar We used BitPar (Schmid, 2004), an efficient general purpose parser,10 together with various treebank grammars to parse the input sentences and propose compatible morphological segmentation and syntactic analysis.', 'We experimented with increasingly rich grammars read off of the treebank.',

feeding it to BitPar.', 'Given a PCFG grammar G and a lattice L with nodes n1 ... nk, we construct the weighted grammar GL as follows: for every arc (lexeme) l E L from node ni to node nj, we add to GL the rule [l --+ tni, tni+1, ... , tnj_1] with a probability of 1 (this indicates the lexeme l spans from node ni to node nj).', 'GL is then used to parse the string tn1 ... tnk_1, where tni is a terminal corresponding to the lattice span between node ni and ni+1.', 'Removing the leaves from the resulting tree yields a parse for L under G, with the desired probabilities.', 'We use a patched

system on the joint disambiguation task.', 'To evaluate the performance on the segmentation task, we report SEG, the standard harmonic means for segmentation Precision and Recall F1 (as defined in Bar-Haim et al. (2005); Tsarfaty (2006)) as well as the segmentation accuracy SEGTok measure indicating the percentage of input tokens assigned the correct exact segmentation (as reported by Cohen and Smith

corresponding to coarse- and fine-grained PoS tagging results (F1) measure.', 'Evaluating parsing results in our joint framework, as argued by Tsarfaty (2006), is not trivial under the joint disambiguation task, as the hypothesized yield need not coincide with the correct one.', 'Our parsing performance measures (SY N) thus report the PARSEVAL extension proposed in Tsarfaty (2006).', 'We further report SYNCS, the parsing metric of Cohen and Smith (2007), to facilitate the comparison.', 'We report the F1 value of both measures.', 'Finally, our U (unparsed) measure is used to report the number of sentences to which our system could not propose a joint analysis.', 'The accuracy results for segmentation, tagging and parsing using our different models and our standard data split are summarized in Table 1.', 'In addition we report for each model its performance on goldsegmented input (GS) to indicate the upper bound 11Overt definiteness errors may be seen as a wrong feature rather

enriching our grammar improves the syntactic performance as well as morphological disambiguation (segmentation and POS tagging) accuracy.', 'This supports our main thesis that decisions taken by single, improved, grammar are beneficial for both tasks.', 'When using the segmentation pruning (using HSPELL) for unseen tokens, performance improves for all tasks as well.', 'Yet we note that the better grammars without pruning outperform the poorer grammars using this technique, indicating that the syntactic context aids, to some extent, the disambiguation of unknown tokens.', 'Table 2 compares the performance of our system on the setup of Cohen and Smith (2007) to the best results reported by them for the same tasks.', 'We first note that the accuracy results of our system are overall higher on their setup, on all measures, indicating that theirs may be an easier dataset.', 'Secondly, for all our models we provide better fine- and coarse-grained POS-tagging accuracy, and all pruned models outperform the Oracle results reported by them.12 In terms of syntactic disambiguation, even the simplest grammar pruned with HSPELL outperforms their non-Oracle results.', 'Without HSPELL-pruning, our simpler grammars are somewhat lagging behind, but as the grammars improve the gap is bridged.', 'The addition of vertical markovization enables non-pruned models to outperform all

sults.', 'Furthermore, the combination of pruning and vertical markovization of the grammar outperforms the Oracle results reported by Cohen and Smith.', 'This essentially means that a better grammar tunes the joint model for optimized syntactic disambiguation at least in as much as their hyper parameters do.', 'An interesting observation is that while vertical markovization benefits all our models, its effect is less evident in Cohen and Smith.', 'On the surface, our model may seem as a special case of Cohen and Smith in which α = 0.', 'However, there is a crucial difference: the morphological probabilities in their model come from discriminative models based on linear context.', 'Many morphological decisions are based on long distance dependencies, and when the global syntactic evidence disagrees with evidence based on local linear context, the two models compete with one another, despite the fact that the PCFG takes also local context into account.', 'In addition, as the CRF and PCFG look at similar sorts of information from within two inherently different models, they are far from independent and optimizing their product is meaningless.', 'Cohen and Smith approach this by introducing the α hyperparameter, which performs best when optimized independently for each sentence (cf.', 'Oracle results).', 'In contrast, our morphological probabilities are based on a unigram, lexeme-based model, and all other (local and non-local) contextual considerations are delegated to the PCFG.', 'This fully generative model caters for real interaction between the syntactic and morphological levels as a part of a single coherent process.', 'Employing a PCFG-based generative framework to make both syntactic and morphological disambiguation decisions is not only theoretically clean and linguistically justified and but also probabilistically apropriate and empirically sound.', 'The overall performance of our joint framework demonstrates that a probability distribution obtained over mere syntactic contexts using a Treebank grammar and a data-driven lexicon outperforms upper bounds proposed by previous joint disambiguation systems and achieves segmentation and parsing results on a par with state-of-the-art standalone applications results.', 'Better grammars are shown here to improve performance on both morphological and syntactic tasks, providing support for the advantage of a joint framework over pipelined or factorized ones.', 'We conjecture that this trend may continue by incorporating additional information, e.g., three-dimensional models as proposed by Tsarfaty and Sima’an (2007).', 'In the current work morphological analyses and lexical probabilities are derived from a small Treebank, which is by no means the best way to go.', 'Using a wide-coverage morphological analyzer based on (Itai et al., 2006) should cater for a better coverage, and incorporating lexical probabilities learned from a big (unannotated) corpus (cf.', '(Levinger et al., 1995; Goldberg et al., ; Adler et al., 2008)) will make the parser more robust and suitable for use in more realistic scenarios.', 'Acknowledgments We

frequent in DDT than in PDT, they seem to be more deeply nested, since only about 80% can be projectivized with a single lift, while almost 95% of the non-projective arcs in PDT only require a single lift.', 'In the second part of the experiment, we applied the inverse transformation based on breadth-first search under the three different encoding schemes.', 'The results are given in Table 4.',

that the results for the least informative encoding, Path, are almost comparable, while the third encoding, Head, gives substantially worse results for both data sets.', 'We also see that the increase in the size of the label sets for Head and Head+Path is far below the theoretical upper bounds given in Table 1.', 'The increase is generally higher for PDT than for DDT, which indicates a greater diversity in non-projective constructions.', 'The second experiment is limited to data from PDT.5 The training part of the treebank was projectivized under different encoding schemes and used to train memory-based dependency parsers, which were run on the test part of the treebank, consisting of 7,507 sentences and 125,713 tokens.6 The inverse transformation was applied to the output of the parsers and the result compared to the gold standard test set.', 'Table 5 shows the overall parsing accuracy attained with the three different encoding schemes, compared to the baseline (no special arc labels) and to training directly on non-projective dependency graphs.', 'Evaluation metrics used are Attachment Score (AS), i.e. the proportion of tokens that are attached to the correct head, and Exact Match (EM), i.e. the proportion of sentences for which the dependency graph exactly matches the gold standard.', 'In the labeled version of these metrics (L) both heads and arc labels must be correct, while the unlabeled version (U) only considers heads.', 'The first thing to note is that projectivizing helps in itself, even if no encoding is used, as seen from the fact that the projective baseline outperforms the non-projective training condition by more than half a percentage point on attachment score, although the gain is much smaller with respect to exact match.', 'The second main result is that the pseudo-projective approach to parsing (using special arc labels to guide an inverse transformation) gives a further improvement of about one percentage point on attachment score.', 'With respect to exact match, the improvement is even more noticeable, which shows quite clearly that even if non-projective dependencies are rare on the token level, they are nevertheless important for getting the global syntactic structure correct.', 'All improvements over the baseline are statistically significant beyond the 0.01 level (McNemar’s test).', 'By contrast, when we turn to a comparison of the three encoding schemes it is hard to find any significant differences, and the overall impression is that it makes little or no difference which encoding scheme is used, as long as there is some indication of which words are assigned their linear head instead of their syntactic head by the projective parser.', 'This may seem surprising, given the experiments reported in section 4, but the explanation is probably that the non-projective dependencies that can be recovered at all are of the simple kind that only requires a single lift, where the encoding of path information is often redundant.', 'It is likely that the more complex cases, where path information could make a difference, are beyond the reach of the parser in most cases.', 'However, if we consider precision, recall and Fmeasure on non-projective dependencies only, as shown in Table 6, some differences begin to emerge.', 'The most informative scheme, Head+Path, gives the highest scores, although with respect to Head the difference is not statistically significant, while the least informative scheme, Path – with almost the same performance on treebank transformation – is significantly lower (p < 0.01).', 'On the other hand, given that all schemes have similar parsing accuracy overall, this means that the Path scheme is the least likely to introduce errors on projective arcs.', 'The overall parsing accuracy obtained with the pseudo-projective approach is still lower than for the best projective parsers.', 'Although the best published results for the Collins parser is 80% UAS (Collins, 1999), this parser reaches 82% when trained on the entire training data set, and an adapted version of Charniak’s parser (Charniak, 2000) performs at 84% (Jan Hajiˇc, pers. comm.).', 'However, the accuracy is considerably higher than previously reported results for robust non-projective parsing of Czech, with a best performance of 73% UAS (Holan, 2004).', 'Compared to related work on the recovery of long-distance dependencies in constituency-based parsing, our approach is similar to that of Dienes and Dubey (2003) in that the processing of non-local dependencies is partly integrated in the parsing process, via an extension of the set of syntactic categories, whereas most other approaches rely on postprocessing only.', 'However, while Dienes and Dubey recognize empty categories in a pre-processing step and only let the parser find their antecedents, we use the parser both to detect dislocated dependents and to predict either the type or the location of their syntactic head (or both) and use post-processing only to transform the graph in accordance with the parser’s analysis.', 'We have presented a new method for non-projective dependency parsing, based on a combination of data-driven projective dependency parsing and graph transformation techniques.', 'The main result is that the combined system can recover non-projective dependencies with a precision sufficient to

examples.', '2.1 Reliable Case Resolutions.', 'The first step in the learning process is to generate training examples consisting of anaphor/antecedent resolutions.', 'BABAR uses two methods to identify anaphors that can be easily and reliably resolved with their antecedent: lexical seeding and syntactic seeding.', '2.1.1 Lexical Seeding It is generally not safe to assume that multiple occurrences of a noun phrase refer to the same entity.', 'For example, the company may refer to Company X in one paragraph and Company Y in another.', 'However, lexically similar NPs usually refer to the same entity in two cases: proper names and existential noun phrases.', 'BABAR uses a named entity recognizer to identify proper names that refer to people and companies.', 'Proper names are assumed to be coreferent if they match exactly, or if they closely match based on a few heuristics.', 'For example, a personâ\x80\x99s full name will match with just their last name (e.g., â\x80\x9cGeorge Bushâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cBushâ\x80\x9d), and a company name will match with and without a corporate suffix (e.g., â\x80\x9cIBM Corp.â\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cIBMâ\x80\x9d).', 'Proper names that match are resolved with each other.', 'The second case involves existential noun phrases (Allen, 1995), which are noun phrases that uniquely specify an object or concept and therefore do not need a prior referent in the discourse.', 'In previous work (Bean and Riloff, 1999), we developed an unsupervised learning algorithm that automatically recognizes definite NPs that are existential without syntactic modification because their meaning is universally understood.', 'For example, a story can mention â\x80\x9cthe FBIâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cthe White Houseâ\x80\x9d, or â\x80\x9cthe weatherâ\x80\x9d without any prior referent in the story.', 'Although these existential NPs do not need a prior referent, they may occur multiple times in a document.', 'By definition, each existential NP uniquely specifies an object or concept, so we can infer that all instances of the same existential NP are coreferent (e.g., â\x80\x9cthe FBIâ\x80\x9d always refers to the same entity).', 'Using this heuristic, BABAR identifies existential definite NPs in the training corpus using our previous learning algorithm (Bean and Riloff, 1999) and resolves all occurrences of the same existential NP with each another.1 2.1.2 Syntactic Seeding BABAR also uses syntactic heuristics to identify anaphors and antecedents that can be easily resolved.', 'Table 1 briefly describes the

Our implementation only resolves NPs that occur in the same document, but in retrospect, one could probably resolve instances of the same existential NP in different documents too.', 'an event.', 'For IE, the system must be able to distinguish between semantically similar noun phrases that play different roles in an event.', 'For example, management succession systems must distinguish between a person who is fired and a person who is hired.', 'Terrorism systems must distinguish between people who perpetrate a crime and people who are victims of a crime.', 'We applied the AutoSlog system (Riloff, 1996) to our unannotated training texts to generate a set of extraction patterns for each domain.', 'Each extraction pattern represents a linguistic expression and a syntactic position indicating where a role filler can be found.', 'For example, kidnapping victims should be extracted from the subject of the verb â\x80\x9ckidnappedâ\x80\x9d when it occurs in the passive voice (the shorthand representation of this pattern would be â\x80\x9c<subject> were kidnappedâ\x80\x9d).', 'The types of patterns produced by AutoSlog are outlined in (Riloff, 1996).', 'Ideally weâ\x80\x99d like to know the thematic role of each extracted noun phrase, but AutoSlog does not generate thematic roles.', 'As a (crude) approximation, we normalize the extraction patterns with respect to active and passive voice and label those extractions as agents or patients.', 'For example, the passive voice pattern â\x80\x9c<subject> were kidnappedâ\x80\x9d and the active voice pattern â\x80\x9ckidnapped <direct object>â\x80\x9d are merged into a single normalized pattern â\x80\x9ckidnapped <patient>â\x80\x9d.2 For the sake of sim plicity, we will refer to these normalized extraction patterns as caseframes.3 These caseframes can capture two types of contextual role information: (1) thematic roles corresponding to events (e.g, â\x80\x9c<agent> kidnappedâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9ckidnapped <patient>â\x80\x9d), and (2) predicate-argument relations associated with both verbs and nouns (e.g., â\x80\x9ckidnapped for <np>â\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cvehicle with <np>â\x80\x9d).', 'We generate these caseframes automatically by running AutoSlog over the training corpus exhaustively so that it literally generates a pattern to extract every noun phrase in the corpus.', 'The learned patterns are then normalized and applied to the corpus.', 'This process produces a large set of caseframes coupled with a list of the noun phrases that they extracted.', 'The contextual role knowledge that BABAR uses for coreference resolution is derived from this caseframe data.', '2.2.2 The Caseframe Network The first type of contextual role knowledge that BABAR learns is the Caseframe Network (CFNet), which identifies caseframes that co-occur in anaphor/antecedent resolutions.', 'Our assumption is that caseframes that co-occur in resolutions often have a 2 This normalization is performed syntactically without semantics, so the agent and patient roles are not guaranteed to hold, but they usually do in practice.', '3 These are not full case frames in the traditional sense, but

kidnappedâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9c<patient> abductedâ\x80\x9d) or related events (e.g., â\x80\x9c<patient> kidnappedâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9c<patient> releasedâ\x80\x9d).', 'We do not attempt to identify the types of relationships that are found.', 'BABAR merely identifies caseframes that frequently co-occur in coreference resolutions.', 'Te rro ris m Na tur al Dis ast ers mu rde r of < NP > kill ed

natural disasters domain, agents are often forces of nature, such as hurricanes or wildfires.', 'Figure 1 reveals that an event that â\x80\x9cdamagedâ\x80\x9d objects may also cause injuries; a disaster that â\x80\x9coccurredâ\x80\x9d may be investigated to find its â\x80\x9ccauseâ\x80\x9d; a disaster may â\x80\x9cwreakâ\x80\x9d havoc as it â\x80\x9ccrossesâ\x80\x9d geographic regions; and

might be coreferent.', 'Given an anaphor, BABAR identifies the caseframe that would extract it from its sentence.', 'For each candidate antecedent, BABAR identifies the caseframe that would extract the candidate, pairs it with the anaphorâ\x80\x99s caseframe, and consults the CF Network to see if this pair of caseframes has co-occurred in previous resolutions.', 'If so, the CF Network reports that the anaphor and candidate may be coreferent.', '2.2.3 Lexical Caseframe Expectations The second type of contextual role knowledge learned by BABAR is Lexical Caseframe Expectations, which are used by the CFLex knowledge source.', 'For each case- frame, BABAR collects the head nouns of noun phrases that were extracted by the caseframe in the training corpus.', 'For each resolution in the training data, BABAR also associates the co-referring expression of an NP with the NPâ\x80\x99s caseframe.', 'For example, if X and Y are coreferent, then both X and Y are considered to co-occur with the caseframe that extracts X as well as the caseframe that extracts Y.

Kennedyâ\x80\x9d).', 'But in most cases they can be used interchangably.', 'For each domain, we created a semantic dictionary by doing two things.', 'First, we parsed the training corpus, collected all the noun phrases, and looked up each head noun in WordNet (Miller, 1990).', 'We tagged each noun with the top-level semantic classes assigned to it in Word- Net.', 'Second, we identified the 100 most frequent nouns in the training corpus and manually labeled them with semantic tags.', 'This step ensures that the most frequent terms for each domain are labeled (in case some of them are not in WordNet) and labeled with the sense most appropriate for the domain.', 'Initially, we planned to compare the semantic classes of an anaphor and a candidate and infer that they might be coreferent if their semantic classes intersected.', 'However, using the top-level semantic classes of WordNet proved to be problematic because the class distinctions are too coarse.', 'For example, both a chair and a truck would be labeled as artifacts, but this does not at all suggest that they are coreferent.', 'So we decided to use semantic class information only to rule out candidates.', 'If two nouns have mutually exclusive semantic classes, then they cannot be coreferent.', 'This solution also obviates the need to perform word sense disambiguation.', 'Each word is simply tagged with the semantic classes corresponding to all of its senses.', 'If these sets do not overlap, then the words cannot be coreferent.', 'The semantic caseframe expectations are used in two ways.', 'One knowledge source, called WordSemCFSem, is analogous to CFLex: it checks whether the anaphor and candidate antecedent are substitutable for one another, but based on their semantic classes instead of the words themselves.', 'Given an anaphor and candidate, BABAR checks (1) whether the semantic classes of the anaphor intersect with the semantic expectations of the caseframe that extracts the candidate, and (2) whether the semantic classes of the candidate intersect with the semantic ex pectations of the caseframe that extracts the anaphor.', 'If one of these checks fails then this knowledge source reports that the candidate is not a viable antecedent for the anaphor.', 'A different knowledge source, called CFSemCFSem, compares the semantic expectations of the caseframe that extracts the anaphor with the semantic expectations of the caseframe that extracts the candidate.', 'If the semantic expectations do not intersect, then we know that the case- frames extract mutually exclusive types of noun phrases.', 'In this case, this knowledge source reports that the candidate is not a viable antecedent for the anaphor.', '2.3 Assigning Evidence Values.', 'Contextual role knowledge provides evidence as to whether a candidate is a plausible antecedent for an anaphor.', 'The two knowledge sources that use semantic expectations, WordSemCFSem and CFSemCFSem, always return values of -1 or 0.', '-1 means that an NP should be ruled out as a possible antecedent, and 0 means that the knowledge source remains neutral (i.e., it has no reason to believe that they cannot be coreferent).', 'The CFLex and CFNet knowledge sources provide positive evidence that a candidate NP and anaphor might be coreferent.', 'They return a value in the range [0,1], where 0 indicates neutrality and 1 indicates the strongest belief that the candidate and anaphor are coreferent.', 'BABAR uses the log-likelihood statistic (Dunning, 1993) to evaluate the strength of a co-occurrence relationship.', 'For each co-occurrence relation (noun/caseframe for CFLex, and caseframe/caseframe for CFNet), BABAR computes its log-likelihood value and looks it up in the Ï\x872 table to obtain a confidence level.', 'The confidence level is then used as the belief value for the knowledge source.', 'For example, if CFLex determines that the log- likelihood statistic for the co-occurrence of a particular noun and caseframe corresponds to the 90% confidence level, then CFLex returns .90 as its belief that the anaphor and candidate are coreferent.', '3 The Coreference Resolution Model.', 'Given a document to process, BABAR uses four modules to perform coreference resolution.', 'First, a non-anaphoric NP classifier identifies definite noun phrases that are existential, using both syntactic rules and our learned existential NP recognizer (Bean and Riloff, 1999), and removes them from the resolution process.', 'Second, BABAR performs reliable case resolution to identify anaphora that can be easily resolved using the lexical and syntactic heuristics described in Section 2.1.', 'Third, all remaining anaphora are evaluated by 11 different knowledge sources: the four contextual role knowledge sources just described and seven general knowledge sources.', 'Finally, a DempsterShafer probabilistic model evaluates the evidence provided by the knowledge sources for all candidate antecedents and makes the final resolution decision.', 'In this section, we describe the seven general knowledge sources and explain how the DempsterShafer model makes resolutions.', '3.1 General Knowledge Sources.', 'Figure 4 shows the seven general knowledge sources (KSs) that represent features commonly used for coreference resolution.', 'The gender, number, and scoping KSs eliminate candidates from consideration.', 'The scoping heuristics are based on the anaphor type: for reflexive pronouns the scope is the current clause, for relative pronouns it is the prior clause following its VP, for personal pronouns it is the anaphorâ\x80\x99s sentence and two preceding sentences, and for definite NPs it is the anaphorâ\x80\x99s sentence and eight preceding sentences.', 'The semantic agreement KS eliminates some candidates, but also provides positive evidence in one case: if the candidate and anaphor both have semantic tags human, company, date, or location that were assigned via NER or the manually labeled dictionary entries.', 'The rationale for treating these semantic labels differently is that they are specific and reliable (as opposed to the WordNet classes, which are more coarse and more noisy due to polysemy).', 'KS Function Ge nde r filters candidate if gender doesnâ\x80\x99t agree.', 'Nu mb er filters candidate if number doesnâ\x80\x99t agree.', 'Sc opi ng filters

The model assumes that evidence also arrives as a probability density function (pdf) over sets of hypotheses.6 Integrating new evidence into the existing model is therefore simply a matter of defining a function to merge pdfs, one representing the current belief system and one representing the beliefs of the new evidence.', 'The DempsterShafer rule for combining pdfs is: to {C}, meaning that it is 70% sure the correct hypothesis is C. The intersection of these sets is the null set because these beliefs are contradictory.', 'The belief value that would have been assigned to the intersection of these sets is .60*.70=.42, but this belief has nowhere to go because the null set is not permissible in the model.7 So this probability mass (.42) has to be redistributed.', 'DempsterShafer handles this by re-normalizing all the belief values with respect to only the non-null sets (this is the purpose of the denominator in Equation 1).', 'In our coreference resolver, we define Î¸ to be the set of all candidate antecedents for an anaphor.', 'Each knowledge source then assigns a probability estimate to each candidate, which represents its belief that the candidate is the antecedent for the anaphor.', 'The probabilities are incorporated into the DempsterShafer model using Equation 1.', 'To resolve the anaphor, we survey the final belief values assigned to each candidateâ\x80\x99s singleton set.', 'If a candidate has a belief value â\x89¥ .50, then we select that candidate as the antecedent for the anaphor.', 'If no candidate satisfies this condition (which is often the case), then the anaphor is left unresolved.', 'One of the strengths of the DempsterShafer model is its natural ability to recognize when several credible hypotheses are still in play.', 'In this situation, BABAR takes the conservative approach and declines to make a resolution.', '4 Evaluation Results.', '4.1 Corpora.', 'We evaluated BABAR on two domains: terrorism and natural disasters.', 'We used the MUC4 terrorism corpus (MUC4 Proceedings, 1992) and news articles from the Reuterâ\x80\x99s text collection8 that had a subject code corresponding to natural disasters.', 'For each domain, we created a blind test set by manually annotating 40 doc uments with anaphoric chains, which represent sets of m3 (S) = ) X â\x88©Y =S 1 â\x88\x92 ) m1 (X ) â\x88\x97 m2 (Y ) m1 (X ) â\x88\x97 m2 (Y ) (1) noun phrases that are coreferent (as done for MUC6 (MUC6 Proceedings, 1995)).', 'In the terrorism domain, 1600 texts were used for training and the 40 test docu X â\x88©Y =â\x88\x85 All sets of hypotheses (and their corresponding belief values) in the current model are crossed with the sets of hypotheses (and belief values) provided by the new evidence.', 'Sometimes, however, these beliefs can be contradictory.', 'For example, suppose the current model assigns a belief value of .60 to {A, B}, meaning that it is 60% sure that the correct hypothesis is either A or B.

challenging task.', 'We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.', 'We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.', 'The first stage identifies a keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets.', 'The second stage links sets which involve the same pairs of individual NEs.', 'A total of 13,976 phrases were grouped.', 'The accuracy of the sets in representing paraphrase ranged from 73% to 99%, depending on the NE categories and set sizes; the accuracy of the links for two evaluated domains was 73% and 86%.', 'One of the difficulties in Natural Language Processing is the fact that there are many ways to express the same thing or event.', 'If the expression is a word or a short phrase (like â\x80\x9ccorporationâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9ccompanyâ\x80\x9d), it is called a â\x80\x9csynonymâ\x80\x9d.', 'There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.', 'If the expression is longer or complicated (like â\x80\x9cA buys Bâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cAâ\x80\x99s purchase of Bâ\x80\x9d), it is called â\x80\x9cparaphraseâ\x80\x9d, i.e. a set of phrases which express the same thing or event.', 'Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.', 'For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâ\x80\x99s query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâ\x80\x99s question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.', 'Also, in Information Extraction (IE), in which the system tries to extract elements of some events (e.g. date and company names of a corporate merger event), several event instances from different news articles have to be aligned even if these are expressed differently.', 'We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.', 'For example, we can easily imagine that the number of paraphrases for â\x80\x9cA buys Bâ\x80\x9d is enormous and it is not possible to create a comprehensive inventory by hand.', 'Also, we donâ\x80\x99t know how many such paraphrase sets are necessary to cover even some everyday things or events.', 'Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.', 'So, there is a limitation that IE can only be performed for a predefined task, like â\x80\x9ccorporate mergersâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cmanagement successionâ\x80\x9d.', 'In order to create an IE system for a new domain, one has to spend a long time to create the knowledge.', 'So, it is too costly to make IE technology â\x80\x9copen- domainâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9con-demandâ\x80\x9d like IR or QA.', 'In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.', 'We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.', 'After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue.', '2.1 Overview.', 'Before explaining our method in detail, we present a brief overview in this subsection.', 'First, from a large corpus, we extract all the NE instance pairs.', 'Here, an NE instance pair is any pair of NEs separated by at most 4 syntactic chunks; for example, â\x80\x9cIBM plans to acquire Lotusâ\x80\x9d.', 'For each pair we also record the context, i.e. the phrase between the two NEs (Step1).', 'Next, for each pair of NE categories, we collect all the contexts and find the keywords which are topical for that NE category pair.', 'We use a simple TF/IDF method to measure the topicality of words.', 'Hereafter, each pair of NE categories will be called a domain; e.g. the â\x80\x9cCompany â\x80\x93 Companyâ\x80\x9d domain, which we will call CC- domain (Step 2).', 'For each domain, phrases which contain the same keyword are gathered to build a set of phrases (Step 3).', 'Finally, we find links between sets of phrases, based on the NE instance pair data (for example, different phrases which link â\x80\x9cIBMâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cLotusâ\x80\x9d) (Step 4).', 'As we shall see, most of the linked sets are paraphrases.', 'This overview is illustrated in Figure 1.', 'Corpus Step 1 NE pair instances Step 2 Step 1.', 'Extract NE instance pairs with contexts First, we extract NE pair instances with their context from the corpus.', 'The sentences in the corpus were tagged by a transformation-based chunker and an NE tagger.', 'The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004].', 'These 140 NE categories are designed by extending MUCâ\x80\x99s 7 NE categories with finer sub-categories (such as Company, Institute, and Political Party for Organization; and Country, Province, and City for Location) and adding some new types of NE categories (Position Title, Product, Event, and Natural Object).', 'All the NE pair instances which co-occur separated by at most 4 chunks are collected along with information about their NE types and the phrase between the NEs (the â\x80\x98contextâ\x80\x99).', 'Figure 2 shows examples of extracted NE pair instances and their contexts.', 'The data is sorted based on the frequency of the context (â\x80\x9ca unit ofâ\x80\x9d appeared 314 times in the corpus) and the NE pair instances appearing with that context are shown with their frequency (e.g. â\x80\x9cNBCâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cGeneral Electric Co.â\x80\x9d appeared 10 times with the context â\x80\x9ca unit ofâ\x80\x9d).', 'Step 2.', 'Find keywords for each NE pair When we look at the contexts for each domain, we noticed that there is one or a few important words which indicate the relation between the NEs (for example, the word â\x80\x9cunitâ\x80\x9d for the phrase â\x80\x9ca unit ofâ\x80\x9d).', 'Once we figure out the important word (e.g. keyword), we believe we can capture the meaning of the phrase by the keyword.', 'We used the TF/ITF metric to identify keywords.', 'keywords Step 3 Sets of phrases based on keywords Step 4 Links between sets of phrases All the contexts collected for a given domain are gathered in a bag and the TF/ITF scores are calculated for all the words except stopwords in the bag.', 'Here, the term frequency (TF) is the frequency of a word in the bag and the inverse term frequency (ITF) is the inverse of the log of the frequency in the entire corpus.', 'Figure 3 Figure 1.', 'Overview of the method 2.2 Step by Step Algorithm.', 'In this section, we will explain the algorithm step by step with examples.', 'Because of their size, the examples (Figures 2 to 4) appear at the end of the paper.', 'shows some keywords with their scores.', 'Step 3.', 'Gather phrases using keywords Next, we select a keyword for each phrase â\x80\x93 the top-ranked word based on the TF/IDF metric.', '(If the TF/IDF score of that word is below a threshold, the phrase is discarded.)', 'We then gather all phrases with the same keyword.', 'Figure 4 shows some such phrase sets based on keywords in the CC-domain.', 'Step 4.', 'Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.', 'However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword.', 'For example, in Figure 3, we can see that the phrases in the â\x80\x9cbuyâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cacquireâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cpurchaseâ\x80\x9d sets are mostly paraphrases.', 'At this step, we will try to link those sets, and put them into a single cluster.', 'Our clue is the NE instance pairs.', 'If the same pair of NE instances is used with different phrases, these phrases are likely to be paraphrases.', 'For example, the two NEs â\x80\x9cEastern Group Plcâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cHanson Plcâ\x80\x9d have the following contexts.', 'Here, â\x80\x9cEGâ\x80\x9d represents â\x80\x9cEastern Group Plcâ\x80\x9d.', 'and â\x80\x9cHâ\x80\x9d represents â\x80\x9cHanson Plcâ\x80\x9d.', 'x EG, has agreed to be bought by H x EG, now owned by H x H to acquire EG x Hâ\x80\x99s agreement to buy EG Three of those phrases are actually paraphrases, but sometime there could be some noise; such as the second phrase above.', 'So, we set a threshold that at least two examples are required to build a link.', 'More examples are shown in Figure 5.', 'Notice that the CC-domain is a special case.', 'As the two NE categories are the same, we canâ\x80\x99t differentiate phrases with different orders of par ticipants â\x80\x93 whether the buying company or the to-be-bought company comes first.', 'The links can solve the problem.', 'As can be seen in the example, the first two phrases have a different order of NE names from the last two, so we can determine that the last two phrases represent a reversed relation.', 'In figure 4, reverse relations are indicated by `*â\x80\x99 next to the frequency.', 'Now we have sets of phrases which share a keyword and we have links between those sets.', '3.1 Corpora.', 'For the experiments, we used four newswire corpora, the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post, The New York Times, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal, all published in 1995.', 'They contain about 200M words (25M, 110M, 40M and 19M words, respectively).', 'All the sentences have been analyzed by our chunker and NE tag- ger.', 'The procedure using the tagged sentences to discover paraphrases takes about one hour on a 2GHz Pentium 4 PC with 1GB of memory.', '3.2 Results.', 'In this subsection, we will report the results of the experiment, in terms of the number of words, phrases or clusters.', 'We will report the evaluation results in the next subsection.', 'Step 1.', 'Extract NE pair instances with contexts From the four years of newspaper corpus, we extracted 1.9 million pairs of NE instances.', 'The most frequent NE category pairs are â\x80\x9cPerson - Person (209,236), followed by â\x80\x9cCountry - Coun- tryâ\x80\x9d (95,123) and â\x80\x9cPerson - Countryâ\x80\x9d (75,509).', 'The frequency of the Company â\x80\x93 Company domain ranks 11th with 35,567 examples.', 'As lower frequency examples include noise, we set a threshold that an NE category pair should appear at least 5 times to be considered and an NE instance pair should appear at least twice to be considered.', 'This limits the number of NE category pairs to 2,000 and the number of NE pair instances to 0.63 million.', 'Step 2.', 'Find keywords for each NE pair The keywords are found for each NE category pair.', 'For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3.', 'It is natural that the larger the data in the domain, the more keywords are found.', 'In the â\x80\x9cPerson â\x80\x93 Personâ\x80\x9d domain, 618 keywords are found, and in the â\x80\x9cCountry â\x80\x93 Countryâ\x80\x9d domain, 303 keywords are found.', 'In total, for the 2,000 NE category pairs, 5,184 keywords are found.', 'Step 3.', 'Gather phrases using keywords Now, the keyword with the top TF/ITF score is selected for each phrase.', 'If a phrase does not contain any keywords, the phrase is discarded.', 'For example, out of 905 phrases in the CC- domain, 211 phrases contain keywords found in step 2.', 'In total, across all domains, we kept 13,976 phrases with keywords.', 'Step 4.', 'Link phrases based on instance pairs Using NE instance pairs as a clue, we find links between sets of phrases.', 'In the CC-domain, there are 32 sets of phrases which contain more than 2 phrases.', 'We concentrate on those sets.', 'Among these 32 sets, we found the following pairs of sets which have two or more links.', 'Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances.', 'buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.', 'We will describe the evaluation of such clusters in the next subsection.', '3.3 Evaluation Results.', 'We evaluated the results based on two metrics.', 'One is the accuracy within a set of phrases which share the same keyword; the other is the accuracy of links.', 'We picked two domains, the CC-domain and the â\x80\x9cPerson â\x80\x93 Companyâ\x80\x9d domain (PC-domain), for the evaluation, as the entire system output was too large to evaluate.', 'It is not easy to make a clear definition of â\x80\x9cparaphraseâ\x80\x9d.', 'Sometimes extracted phrases by themselves are not meaningful to consider without context, but we set the following criteria.', 'If two phrases can be used to express the same relationship within an information extraction application (â\x80\x9cscenarioâ\x80\x9d), these two phrases are paraphrases.', 'Although this is not a precise criterion, most cases we evaluated were relatively clear-cut.', 'In general, different modalities (â\x80\x9cplanned to buyâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cagreed to buyâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cboughtâ\x80\x9d) were considered to express the same relationship within an extraction setting.', 'We did have a problem classifying some modified noun phrases where the modified phrase does not represent a qualified or restricted form of the head, like â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d, as these are both represented by the keyword â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d.', 'In this specific case, as these two titles could fill the same column of an IE table, we regarded them as paraphrases for the evaluation.', 'Evaluation within a set The evaluation of paraphrases within a set of phrases which share a keyword is illustrated in Figure 4.', 'For each set, the phrases with bracketed frequencies are considered not paraphrases in the set.', ""For example, the phrase â\x80\x9c's New York-based trust unit,â\x80\x9d is not a paraphrase of the other phrases in the â\x80\x9cunitâ\x80\x9d set."", 'As you can see in the figure, the accuracy for the domain is quite high except for the â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d set, which contains various expressions representing different relationships for an IE application.', 'The accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the number of paraphrases to the total number of phrases in the set.', 'The results, along with the total number of phrases, are shown in Table 1.', 'D o m ai n # of ph ras es t o t a l p h r a s e s ac cu ra cy C C 7 o r m o r e 1 0 5 8 7 . 6 % 6 o r l e s s 1 0 6 6 7 . 0 % P C 7 o r m o r e 3 5 9 9 9 . 2 % 6 o r l e s s 2 5 5 6 5 . 1 % Table 1.', 'Evaluation results within sets Table 1 shows the evaluation result based on the number of phrases in a set.', 'The larger sets are more accurate than the small sets.', 'We can make several observations on the cause of errors.', 'One is that smaller sets sometime have meaningless keywords, like â\x80\x9cstrengthâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9caddâ\x80\x9d in the CC-domain, or â\x80\x9ccompareâ\x80\x9d in the PC-domain.', 'Eight out of the thirteen errors in the high frequency phrases in the CC-domain are the phrases in â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d.', 'As can be seen in Figure 3, the phrases in the â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d set include completely different relationships, which are not paraphrases.', 'Other errors include NE tagging errors and errors due to a phrase which includes other NEs.', 'For example, in the phrase â\x80\x9cCompany-A last week purchased rival Marshalls from Company-Bâ\x80\x9d, the purchased company is Marshalls, not Company-B.', 'Also there are cases where one of the two NEs belong to a phrase outside of the relation.', 'For example, from the sentence â\x80\x9cMr.', 'Smith estimates Lotus will make a profit this quarterâ\x80¦â\x80\x9d, our system extracts â\x80\x9cSmith esti mates Lotusâ\x80\x9d as an instance.', 'Obviously â\x80\x9cLotusâ\x80\x9d is part of the following clause rather than being the object of â\x80\x9cestimatesâ\x80\x9d and the extracted instance makes no sense.', 'We will return to these issues in the discussion section.', 'Evaluation of links A link between two sets is considered correct if the majority of phrases in both sets have the same meaning, i.e. if the link indicates paraphrase.', 'All the links in the â\x80\x9cCC-domain are shown in Step 4 in subsection 3.2.', 'Out of those 15 links, 4 are errors, namely â\x80\x9cbuy - payâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cacquire - payâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cpurchase - stakeâ\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cacquisition - stakeâ\x80\x9d.', 'When a company buys another company, a paying event can occur, but these two phrases do not indicate the same event.', 'The similar explanation applies to the link to the â\x80\x9cstakeâ\x80\x9d set.', 'We checked whether the discovered links are listed in WordNet.', 'Only 2 link in the CC- domain (buy-purchase, acquire-acquisition) and 2 links (trader-dealer and head-chief) in the PC- domain are found in the same synset of Word- Net 2.1 (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/).', 'This result suggests the benefit of using the automatic discovery method.', 'D o m ai n Li n k ac cu ra cy W N c o v e r a g e C C 7 3 . 3 % 2 / 1 1 P C 8 8 . 9 % 2 / 8 Table 2.', 'Evaluation results for links', 'The work reported here is closely related to [Ha- segawa et al. 04].', 'First, we will describe their method and compare it with our method.', 'They first collect the NE instance pairs and contexts, just like our method.', 'However, the next step is clearly different.', 'They cluster NE instance pairs based on the words in the contexts using a bag- of-words method.', 'In order to create good-sized vectors for similarity calculation, they had to set a high frequency threshold, 30.', 'Because of this threshold, very few NE instance pairs could be used and hence the variety of phrases was also limited.', 'Instead, we focused on phrases and set the frequency threshold to 2, and so were able to utilize a lot of phrases while minimizing noise.', '[Hasegawa et al. 04] reported only on relation discovery, but one could easily acquire para phrases from the results.', 'The number of NE instance pairs used in their experiment is less than half of our method.', 'There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.', 'One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].', 'The availability of comparable corpora is limited, which is a significant limitation on the approach.', 'Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].', 'This approach needs a phrase as an initial seed and thus the possible relationships to be extracted are naturally limited.', 'There has also been work using a bootstrap- ping approach [Brin 98; Agichtein and Gravano 00; Ravichandran and Hovy 02].', 'The basic strategy is, for a given pair of entity types, to start with some examples, like several famous book title and author pairs; and find expressions which contains those names; then using the found expressions, find more author and book title pairs.', 'This can be repeated several times to collect a list of author / book title pairs and expressions.', 'However, those methods need initial seeds, so the relation between entities has to be known in advance.', 'This limitation is the obstacle to making the technology â\x80\x9copen domainâ\x80\x9d.', 'Keywords with more than one word In the evaluation, we explained that â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d are considered paraphrases.', 'However, it is desirable if we can separate them.', 'This problem arises because our keywords consist of only one word.', 'Sometime, multiple words are needed, like â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cprime ministerâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cpay forâ\x80\x9d (â\x80\x9cpayâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cpay forâ\x80\x9d are different senses in the CC-domain).', 'One possibility is to use n-grams based on mutual information.', 'If there is a frequent multi-word sequence in a domain, we could use it as a keyword candidate.', 'Keyword detection error Even if a keyword consists of a single word, there are words which are not desirable as keywords for a domain.', 'As was explained in the results section, â\x80\x9cstrengthâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9caddâ\x80\x9d are not desirable keywords in the CC-domain.', 'In our experiment, we set the threshold of the TF/ITF score empirically using a small development corpus; a finer adjustment of the threshold could reduce the number of such keywords.', 'Also, â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d in the CC-domain is not a desirable keyword.', 'It is a relatively frequent word in the domain, but it can be used in different extraction scenarios.', 'In this domain the major scenarios involve the things they agreed on, rather than the mere fact that they agreed.', 'â\x80\x9cAgreeâ\x80\x9d is a subject control verb, which dominates another verb whose subject is the same as that of â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d; the latter verb is generally the one of interest for extraction.', 'We have checked if there are similar verbs in other major domains, but this was the only one.', 'Using structural information As was explained in the results section, we extracted examples like â\x80\x9cSmith estimates Lotusâ\x80\x9d, from a sentence like â\x80\x9cMr.', 'Smith estimates Lotus will make profit this quarterâ\x80¦â\x80\x9d.', 'In order to solve this problem, a parse tree is needed to understand that â\x80\x9cLotusâ\x80\x9d is not the object of â\x80\x9cestimatesâ\x80\x9d.', 'Chunking is not enough to find such relationships.', 'This remains as future work.', 'Limitations There are several limitations in the methods.', 'The phrases have to be the expressions of length less than 5 chunks, appear between two NEs.', 'Also, the method of using keywords rules out phrases which donâ\x80\x99t contain popular words in the domain.', 'We are not claiming that this method is almighty.', 'Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.', 'Applications The discovered paraphrases have multiple applications.', 'One obvious application is information extraction.', 'In IE, creating the patterns which express the requested scenario, e.g. â\x80\x9cmanagement successionâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9ccorporate merger and acquisitionâ\x80\x9d is regarded as the hardest task.', 'The discovered paraphrases can be a big help to reduce human labor and create a more comprehensive pattern set.', 'Also, expanding on the techniques for the automatic generation of extraction patterns (Riloff 96; Sudo 03) using our method, the extraction patterns which have the same meaning can be automatically linked, enabling us to produce the final table fully automatically.', 'While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.', 'We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.', 'We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.', 'After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kind of cue.', 'In total 13,976 phrases are assigned to sets of phrases, and the accuracy on our evaluation data ranges from 65 to 99%, depending on the domain and the size of the sets.', 'The accuracies for link were 73% and 86% on two evaluated domains.', 'These results are promising and there are several avenues for improving on these results.', 'This research was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research
