The bias of automatic methods in favour of statistical systems seemed to be less pronounced on out-of-domain test data.,Almost all annotators expressed their preference to move to a ranking-based evaluation in the future.,0
"Instance-weighting approach improved over a wide range of baselines, giving gains of over 2 BLEU points over the best non-adapted baseline.","The linear LM (lin lm), TM (lin tm) and MAP TM (map tm) used with non-adapted counterparts perform in all cases slightly worse than the log-linear combination, which adapts both LM and TM components.",0

They proposed a single joint model for performing both morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation which bypasses the associated circularity.,Our use of an unweighted lattice reflects our belief that all the segmentations of the given input sentence are a-priori equally likely; the only reason to prefer one segmentation over the another is due to the overall syntactic context which is modeled via the PCFG derivations.,0

Their empirical results demonstrate that the type-based tagger rivals state-of-the-art tag-level taggers which employ more sophisticated learning mechanisms to exploit similar constraints.,A crucial difference is that the number of parameters is greatly reduced as is the number of variables that are sampled during each iteration.,0
The fact that projective dependency parsers can never exactly reproduce the analyses found in non-projective tree banks is often neglected because of the relative scarcity of problematic constructions.,"In principle, it would be possible to encode the exact position of the syntactic head in the label of the arc from the linear head, but this would give a potentially infinite set of arc labels and would make the training of the parser very hard.",0

"Across eight European languages, their approach results in an average absolute improvement of 10.4% over a state-of-the-art baseline, and 16.7% over vanilla hidden Markov models induced with the Expectation Maximization algorithm.","In other words, the set of hidden states F was chosen to be the fine set of treebank tags.",0
The authors use linguistic and annotation insights to develop a manually annotated grammar and evaluate it and finally provide a realistic evaluation in which segmentation is performed in a pipeline jointly with parsing.,All three curves remain steep at the maximum training set size of 18818 trees.,0
There are clustering approaches that assign a single POS tag to each word type.,This departure from the traditional token-based tagging approach allows us to explicitly capture type- level distributional properties of valid POS tag as signments as part of the model.,0
The evaluation compares the performance of the system with that of several human judges and inter-human agreement on a single correct way to segment a text.,"For example, the Wang, Li, and Chang system fails on the sequence 1:f:p:]nian2 nei4 sa3 in (k) since 1F nian2 is a possible, but rare, family name, which also happens to be written the same as the very common word meaning 'year.'",0
The corpus was annoted with different linguitic information.,"Our annotators pointed out that very often they made almost random decisions as to what relation to choose, and where to locate the boundary of a span.",0
They proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.,"As can be seen in the example, the first two phrases have a different order of NE names from the last two, so we can determine that the last two phrases represent a reversed relation.",0

"NER is useful in many NLP applications such as information extraction, question answering, etc .Chieu and Ng have shown that the maximum entropy framework is able to use global information directly from various sources.","For every sequence of initial capitalized words, its longest substring that occurs in the same document as a sequence of initCaps is identified.",0
"Explanations for this phenomenon are relative informativeness of lexicalization, insensitivity to morphology and the effect of variable word order and these factors lead to syntactic disambiguation.","As we have said, parse quality decreases with sentence length.",0
Their work is closely related to recent approaches that incorporate the sparsity constraint into the POS induction process.,A graphical depiction of our model as well as a summary of random variables and parameters can be found in Figure 1.,0
"This topic has been getting more attention, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.","Find keywords for each NE pair When we look at the contexts for each domain, we noticed that there is one or a few important words which indicate the relation between the NEs (for example, the word âunitâ for the phrase âa unit ofâ).",0
"Due to many similarly performing systems, the author was not able to draw strong conclusions on the question of correlation of manual and automatic evaluation metrics.",Given the closeness of most systems and the wide over-lapping confidence intervals it is hard to make strong statements about the correlation between human judgements and automatic scoring methods such as BLEU.,0

They employed a PCFG-based generative framework to make both syntactic and morphological disambiguation decisions which were not only theoretically clean and linguistically justified but also probabilistically appropriate and empirically sound.,"A possible probabilistic model for assigning probabilities to complex analyses of a surface form may be and indeed recent sequential disambiguation models for Hebrew (Adler and Elhadad, 2006) and Arabic (Smith et al., 2005) present similar models.",0
"Their method did not assume any knowledge about the target language, making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages.","Fortunately, performance was stable across various values, and we were able to use the same hyperparameters for all languages.",0
"It is annotated with several data: morphology, syntax, rhetorical structure, connectors, correference and informative structure.","Upon identifying an anaphoric expression (currently restricted to: pronouns, prepositional adverbs, definite noun phrases), the an- notator first marks the antecedent expression (currently restricted to: various kinds of noun phrases, prepositional phrases, verb phrases, sentences) and then establishes the link between the two.",0
The authors use linguistic and annotation insights to develop a manually annotated grammar and evaluate it and finally provide a realistic evaluation in which segmentation is performed in a pipeline jointly with parsing.,But Arabic contains a variety of linguistic phenomena unseen in English.,0
"They showed that it was useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees, find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by Context-Free Grammars.",We can show that languages generated by LCFRS's are semilinear as long as the composition operation does not remove any terminal symbols from its arguments.,0
"The resulting model is compact, efficiently learnable and linguistically expressive.",5 We choose these two metrics over the Variation Information measure due to the deficiencies discussed in Gao and Johnson (2008).,0
"The problem of coreference resolution has received considerable attention, including theoretical discourse models and supervised machine learning systems.",Each word is simply tagged with the semantic classes corresponding to all of its senses.,0
They found replacing it with a ranked evaluation to be more suitable.,"We check, how likely only up to k = 20 better scores out of n = 100 would have been generated by two equal systems, using the binomial distribution: If p(0..k; n, p) < 0.05, or p(0..k; n, p) > 0.95 then we have a statistically significant difference between the systems.",0
The authors cluster NE instance pairs based on the words in the context using bag-of-words methods.,This approach needs a phrase as an initial seed and thus the possible relationships to be extracted are naturally limited.,0
"However, these approaches are ill-equipped to directly represent type-based constraints such as sparsity.","Tag set As is standard, for all experiments, we set the number of latent model tag states to the size of the annotated tag set.",0
Their empirical results demonstrate that the type-based tagger rivals state-of-the-art tag-level taggers which employ more sophisticated learning mechanisms to exploit similar constraints.,5 70.1 58.,0
The authors believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.,"For example, in Figure 3, we can see that the phrases in the âbuyâ, âacquireâ and âpurchaseâ sets are mostly paraphrases.",0

"BABAR's performance in both domains of terrorism and natural disaster, and the contextual-role knowledge in pronouns have shown successful results.","For example, even if the contexts surrounding an anaphor and candidate match exactly, they are not coreferent if they have substantially different meanings 9 We would be happy to make our manually annotated test data available to others who also want to evaluate their coreference resolver on the MUC4 or Reuters collections.",0
"Bean and Riloff also used bootstrapping to extend their semantic compatibility model, proposed using caseframe network for anaphora resolution, information extraction patterns to identify contextual clues for determining compatibility between NPs.","Our results show that BABAR achieves good performance in both domains, and that the contextual role knowledge improves performance, especially on pronouns.",0

"It is annotated with several data: morphology, syntax, rhetorical structure, connectors, correference and informative structure.","In (Reitter, Stede 2003) we went a different way and suggested URML5, an XML format for underspecifying rhetorical structure: a number of relations can be assigned instead of a single one, competing analyses can be represented with shared forests.",0
The model incorporates various recent techniques for incorporating and manipulating linguistic knowledge using finite-state transducers.,"Clearly, for judges h and h taking h as standard and computing the precision and recall for Jz yields the same results as taking h as the standard, and computing for h, 14 All evaluation materials, with the exception of those used for evaluating personal names were drawn.",0

In this paper the authors present a stochastic finite-state model for segmenting Chinese text into words.,The first is an evaluation of the system's ability to mimic humans at the task of segmenting text into word-sized units; the second evaluates the proper-name identification; the third measures the performance on morphological analysis.,0
The authors show that PATB is similar to other tree-banks but that annotation consistency remains low.,markBaseNP indicates these non-recursive nominal phrases.,0
The overall performance of their joint framework demonstrated that a probability distribution obtained over mere syntactic contexts using a Treebank grammar and a data-driven lexicon outperformed upper bounds proposed by previous joint disambiguation systems and achieved segmentation and parsing results on a par with state-of-the-art standalone applications results.,Our smoothing procedure takes into account all the aforementioned aspects and works as follows.,0
"Finally, several coreference systems have successfully incorporated anaphoricity determination modules.",The contextual role knowledge that BABAR uses for coreference resolution is derived from this caseframe data.,0
"They showed better grammars to improve performance on both morphological and syntactic tasks, providing support for the advantage of a joint framework over pipelined or factorized ones.","In order to pass these constraints onto the parser, the lexical rules in the grammar are of the form pi —* (si, pi) Parameter Estimation The grammar probabilities are estimated from the corpus using simple relative frequency estimates.",0
A beam search concept is applied as in speech recognition.,"In many cases, there is an even stronger restriction: over large portions of the source string, the alignment is monotone.",0

The authors cluster NE instance pairs based on the words in the context using bag-of-words methods.,"For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3.",0
Their work is closely related to recent approaches that incorporate the sparsity constraint into the POS induction process.,Table 5 provides insight into the behavior of different models in terms of the tagging lexicon they generate.,0
They have made use of local and global features to deal with the instances of same token in a document.,"If is not initCaps, then (not-initCaps, ) is set to 1.",0
"they showed that the average agreement among the human judges is .76, and the average agreement between ST(system) and the humans is .75, or about 99% of the interhuman agreement.",2.,0
"Across eight European languages, their approach results in an average absolute improvement of 10.4% over a state-of-the-art baseline, and 16.7% over vanilla hidden Markov models induced with the Expectation Maximization algorithm.","For each language under consideration, Petrov et al. (2011) provide a mapping A from the fine-grained language specific POS tags in the foreign treebank to the universal POS tags.",0
In this paper the authors present a stochastic finite-state model for segmenting Chinese text into words.,"All notions of word, with the exception of the orthographic word, are as relevant in Chinese as they are in English, and just as is the case in other languages, a word in Chinese may correspond to one or more symbols in the orthog 1 For a related approach to the problem of word-segrnention in Japanese, see Nagata (1994), inter alia..",0
All the texts were annotated by two people.,"Consequently, we implemented our own annotation tool ConAno in Java (Stede, Heintze 2004), which provides specifically the functionality needed for our purpose.",0
This paper presents a maximum entropy-based named entity recognizer (NER).,He used an additional maximum entropy classifier that tries to correct mistakes by using reference resolution.,0
"However, using the top-level semantic classes of WordNet proved to be problematic as the class distinctions are too coarse.","Sometimes, however, these beliefs can be contradictory.",0
"Due to many similarly performing systems, they are not able to draw strong conclusions on the question of correlation of manual and automatic evaluation metrics.","Since the inclusion of out-ofdomain test data was a very late decision, the participants were not informed of this.",0
The authors in this paper describe a search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP).,"Source sentence words are aligned with hypothesized target sentence words, where the choice of a new source word, which has not been aligned with a target word yet, is restricted1.",0

The manual evaluation of scoring translation on a graded scale from 1&#8211;5 seemed to be very hard to perform.,The bias of automatic methods in favor of statistical systems seems to be less pronounced on out-of-domain test data.,0
"They showed better grammars to improve performance on both morphological and syntactic tasks, providing support for the advantage of a joint framework over pipelined or factorized ones.","The input for the segmentation task is however highly ambiguous for Semitic languages, and surface forms (tokens) may admit multiple possible analyses as in (BarHaim et al., 2007; Adler and Elhadad, 2006).",0
The AdaBoost algorithm was developed for supervised learning.,"Unfortunately, Yarowsky's method is not well understood from a theoretical viewpoint: we would like to formalize the notion of redundancy in unlabeled data, and set up the learning task as optimization of some appropriate objective function.",0
The first method builds on results from (Yarowsky 95) and (Blum and Mitchell 98).,"Yarowsky-cautious does not separate the spelling and contextual features, but does have a limit on the number of rules added at each stage.",0
"they showed that the average agreement among the human judges is .76, and the average agreement between ST(system) and the humans is .75, or about 99% of the interhuman agreement.","However, it is almost universally the case that no clear definition of what constitutes a ""correct"" segmentation is given, so these performance measures are hard to evaluate.",0
They found replacing it with a ranked evaluation to be more suitable.,"However, it is also mostly political content (even if not focused on the internal workings of the European Union) and opinion.",0
"In this paper, Ben and Riloff present a coreference resolver called BABAR that focuses on the use of contextual-role knowledge for coreference resolution.","In recent years, coreference resolvers have been evaluated as part of MUC6 and MUC7 (MUC7 Proceedings, 1998).",0
