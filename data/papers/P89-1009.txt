uk ABSTRACT This paper describes the referring expression generation mechanisms used in EPICURE, a com- puter program which produces natural language descriptions of cookery recipes.
Major features of the system include: an underlying ontology which permits the representation f non-singular entities; a notion of diacriminatory power, to determine what properties hould be used in a description; and a PATR-like unification grammar to produce surface linguistic strings.
INTRODUCTION EPICURE (Dale 1989a, 1989b) is a natural lan- guage generation system whose principal concern is the generation of referring expressions which pick out complex entities in connected iscourse.
In particular, the system generates natural lan- guage descriptions of cookery recipes.
Given a top level goal, the program first decomposes that goal recursively to produce a plan consisting of oper- ations at a level of detail commensurate with the assumed knowledge of the hearer.
In order to de- scribe the resulting plan, EPICURE then models its execution, so that the processes which produce referring expressions always have access to a rep- resentation of the ingredients in the state they are in at the time of description.
This paper describes that part of the system responsible for the generation of subsequent refer- ring expressions, i.e., references to entities which have already been mentioned in the discourse.
The most notable features of the approach taken here are as follows: (a) the use of a sophisticated un- derlying ontology, to permit the representation f non-singular entities; (b) the use of two levels of se- mantic representation, i  conjunction with a model of the discourse, to produce appropriate anaphoric referring expressions; (c) the use of a notion of dis- crimiaatory power, to determine what properties should be used in describing an entity; and (d) the use of a PATR-1ike unification grammar (see, for ex- ample, Karttunen (1986); Shieber (1986)) to pro- duce surface linguistic strings from input semantic structures.
THE REPRESENTATION OF INGREDIENTS In most natural anguage systems, it is assumed that all the entities in the domain of discourse are singular individuals.
In more complex domains, such as recipes, this simplification is of limited value, since a large proportion of the objects we find are masses or sets, such as those described by the noun phrases two ounces of salt and three pounds of carrots respectively.
In order to permit the representation f enti- ties such as these, EPICURE makes use of a notion of a generalized physical object or physob].
This permits a consistent representation f entities irre- spective of whether they are viewed as individuals, masses or sets, by representing each as a knowledge base entity (KBE) with an appropriate structure at.
The knowledge base entity corresponding to three pounds of carrots, for example, is that shown in figure 1.
A knowledge base entity models a physobj in a particular state.
An entity may change during the course of a recipe, as processes are applied to it: in particular, apart from gaining new properties such as being peeled, chopped, etc., an ingredients structure may change, for example, from set to mass.
Each such change of state results in the creation of a new knowledge base entity.
Suppose, for example, a grating event is applied to our three pounds of carrots between states so and sl: the entity shown in figure i will then become a mass of grated carrot, represented in state sl by the KBE shown in figure 2.
BUILDING A REFERRING EXPRESS ION To construct a referring expression corresponding to a knowledge base entity, we first build a deep se- 68 KBE -~ indus = ZO state = so structure = set quantity = [ num~erUnit = pound= 3 ] speC = structure = indiv idual substance = carrot - , - -  [ ] packaging = ehape= carrot ?

We call this the recoverable semantic content, since it con- sists of just that information the hearer should be able to derive from the corresponding utter- ance, even if that information is not stated explic- itly: in particular, elided elements and instances of oae-anaphora are represented in the deep seman- tic structure by their more semantically complete counterparts, as we will see below.
From the deep semantic structure, a surface semantic structure is then constructed.
Unlike the deep semantic structure, this closely matches the syntactic structure of the resulting noun phrase, and is suitable for passing directly to a PATR-like unification grammar.
It is at the level of surface semantic structure that processes such as elision and one-anaphora take place.
PRONOMINAL IZAT ION When an entity is to be referred to, we first check to see if pronominalisation is possible.
Some pre- vious approaches to the pronominalization deci.
don have taken into account a large number of contextual factors (see, for example, McDonald (1980:218-220)).
The approach taken here is rel- atively simple.
EPICURE makes use of a discourse model which distinguishes two principal compo- nents, corresponding to Groszs (1977) distinction between local focus and global focus.
We call that part of the discourse model corresponding to the local focus cache memory: this contains the lex- ical, syntactic and semantic detail of the current utterance being generated, and the same detail for the previous utterance.
Corresponding to global focus, the discourse model consists of a number of hierarchically-arranged focua spaces, mirroring the structure of the recipe being described.
These focus spaces record the semantic content, but not the syntactic or lexlcal detail, of the remainder of the preceding discourse.
In addition, we make use of a notion of discourse centre: this is intu- itively similar to the notion of centering suggested by (]ross, Joshi and Weinstein (1983), and corre- sponds to the focus of attention in the discourse.
In recipes, we take the centre to be the result of 69 the previous operation described.
Thus, after an utterance like Soak the butterbeaa.s the centre is the entity described by the noun phrase the but- terbeans.
Subsequent references to the centre can be pronominalized, so that the next instruction in the recipe might then be Drain and dnse tltem.
Following Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein (1983), references to other entities present in cache mem- ory may also be pronominalized, provided the cen- tre is pronominalized.
1 If the intended referent is the current centre, then this is marked as part of the status infor- mation in the deep semantic structure being con- structed, and a null value is specified for the struc- tures descriptive content.
In addition, the verb case frame used to construct he utterance speci- fies whether or not the linguistic realization of the entity filling each case role is obligatory: as we will see below, this allows us to model a common linguistic phenomenon in recipes (recipe contezt empty objects, after Massam and Roberge (1989)).
For a case role whose surface realization is obliga- tory, the resulting deep semantic structure is then as follows: D$ = i nde :  : : [ N~en = + statttm : e.cntrs : t sem : oblig -~ + "Pec = [ "PC=q)  I This will be realized as either a pronoun or an elided NP, generated from a surface semantic struc- ture which is constructed in accordance with the following rules: ?
If the status includes the features [centre, +] and [oblig, +], then there should be a cor- responding element in the surface semantic structure, with a null value specified for the descriptive content of the noun phrase to be generated; t We do not permit  pronominal reference to entit ies last ment ioned before the previous utterance: support  for this restriction comes from a study by Hobbs, who, in a sam- ple of one hundred consecutive ~.amples of pronouns from each of three very different texts, found that  98% of an- tecedents were either in the same or previous sentence (Hobbs 1978:322-323).
However, see Dale (1988) for a sug- gestion as to how the few instances of/onc-dbt~a.e pronom- inalimtion that  do exist might be explained by means  of a theory of discourse structure like that  suggested by Gross and Sidner (1986).
I f  the status includes the features [centre, +] and [oblig,-], then this participant should be omitted from the surface semantic struc- ture altogether.
In the former case, this will result in a pronominal reference as in Remove them, where the surface se- mantic structure corresponding to the pronominal form is as follows: i nd~z  = z s ta tus  : [ SS = "1 g iven  = + | J centre = ~r oblig = + [ nu~ = pl agr 8p~ ~--- C CG$~ = GCC &*c  = However, if the participant ismarked as non-obligatory, then reference to the entity is omitted, as in the following: Fry the onions.
Add the garlic ~b.
Here, the case frame for add specifies that the in- direct object is non-obllgatory; since the entity which fills this case role is also the centre, the complete prepositional phrase to the onions can be elided.
Note, however, that the entity corre- sponding to the onions still figures in the deep semantic structure; thus, it is integrated into the discourse model, and is deemed to be part of the semantic ontent recoverable by the hearer.
FULL  DEF IN ITE  NOUN PHRASE REFERENCE If pronominalization is ruled out, we have to build an appropriate description of the intended refer- ent.
In EPICURE, the process of constructing a description is driven by two principles, very like Gricean conversational maxims (Grice 1975).
The p~nciple of adequacy requires that a referring ex- pression should identify the intended referent un- ambiguously, and provide sufficient information to serve the purpose of the reference; and the princi- ple of e~ciency, pulling in the opposite direction, requires that the referring expression used must not contain more information than is necessary for the task at hand.
2 These principles are implemented in EPICUItE 2Similar considerations are discussed by Appelt  (1985).

Sup- pose that we have a set of entities U such that U = {z l , z2 , .
, x ,} and that we wish to distinguish one of these en- tities, zl, from all the others.
Suppose, also, that the domain includes a number of attributes (a I, a~, and so on), and that each attribute has a number of permissible values {v,,t, v,,2, and so on}; and that each entity is described by a set of attribute- value pairs.
In order to distinguish z~ from the other entities in U, we need to find some set of attribute-value pairs which are together true of zl, but of no other entity in U.
This set of attribute- value pairs constitutes a distinguishing descriptior, of xl with respect to the ,~ontext U.
A mini- mal distinguishing description is then a set of such attribute-value pairs, where the cardinality of that set is such that there are no other sets of attribute- value pairs of lesser cardinality which are sufficient to distinguish the intended referent.
We find a minimal distinguishing description by observing that different attribute-value pairs differ in the effectiveness with which they distin- guish an entity from a set of entities.
Suppose U has N elements, where N > I.
Then, any attribute-value pair true of the intended referent zl will be true of n entities in this set, where n >_ i.
For any attribute-value pair < a, v > that is true of the intended referent, we can compute the discriminatory power (notated here as F) of that attribute-value pair with respect to U as fol- lows" ~(< ~,v>, U) = ~-~ l<n<N F thus has as its range the interval [0,1], where a value of 1 for a given attribute-value pair indi- cates that the attribute-value pair singles out the intended referent from the conte?t, and a value of 7] DS -~- i ndez  = z2 s ta tus  = SSf~t SpSC -~ [ #/uen= + ] unique = + number  = sg agr  = countab le  ---- + type  = ] categor l !

Given an intended referent and a set of entities from which the intended referent must be distin- guished, this notion is used to determine which set of properties should be used in building a descrip- tion which is both adequate and efficient.
3 There remains the question of how the constituency of the set U of entities is determined: in the present work, we  take the context always to consist of the working set.
This is the set of distinguishable enti- sstrictly speaking, this mechanism is only applicable in the form described here to those properties of an entity which are realizable by what are known as abJolute (or t~- tereect/ee or pred~tiee) adjectives (see, for example, Kamp (1975), Keenan and FaRm (1978)).
This is acceptable in the current domain, where many of the adjectives used are derived from the verbs used to describe processes applied to entities.
ties in the domain at any given point in time: the constituency of this set changes as a recipe pro- ceeds, since entities may be created or destroyed.
4 Suppose, for example, we  determine that we must identify a given object as being a set of olives which have been pitted (in a context, for example, where there are also olives which have not been pitted}; the corresponding deep semantic struc- ture is then as in figure 3.
Note that this deep semantic structure can be realized in at least two ways: as either the olives which have been pitted or the pitted olives.
4A slightly more sophisticated approach would be to restrict U to exclude those entities which are, in G rosz and Sidners (1986) terms, only present in closed focus spaces.
However, the benefit gained from doing this (if indeed it is a valid thing to do) is minimal in the current context because of the small number of entities we are dealing with.

Thus, the generation algorithm is non-deterministic in this respect (although one might imagine there are other factors which determine which of the two re- alizations is preferrable in a given context}.
The surface semantic structure for the simpler of the two noun phrase structures is as shown in figure 4.
ONE ANAPHORA The algorithms employed in EPICURE also permit the generation of onc-anaphora, as in Slice the large green capsicum.
Now remove the top of the small red one.
The deep semantic structure corresponding to the noun phrase the small red one is as shown in fig- ure 5.
The mechanisms which construct the surface semantic structure determine whether one-anaphora is possible by comparing the deep semantic struc- ture corresponding to the previous utterance with that corresponding to the current utterance, to identify any elements they have in common.
The two distinct levels of semantic representation play an important role here: in the deep semantic struc- ture, only the basic semantic category of the de scription has special status (this is similar to Wel>- hers (1979) use of restricted quantification), whereas the embedding of the surface semantic structures dcsc feature closely matches that of the noun phrase to be generated.
For one-anaphora to be possi- ble, the two deep semantic structures being com- pared must have the same value for the feature addressed by the path <sere spec type category>.
Rules which specify the relative ordering of ad- jectives in the surface form are then used to build an appropriately nested surface semantic structure which, when unified with the grammar, will result in the required one-anaphoric noun phrase.
In the present example, this results in the surface seman- tic structure in figure 6.
PSEUDO-PARTIT I VE  NPS Partitive and pseudo-partitive noun phrases, ex- emplified by half  of  the carrots and three pounds of carrots respectively, are very common in recipes; EPICURE is capable of generating both.
So, for example, the pseudo-partitive noun phrase three pounds of carrots (as represented by the knowledge base entity shown in figure 1) is generated from the deep semantic structure shown in figure 7 via the surface semantic structure shown in figure 8.
The generation of partitive noun phrases re- quires slightly different semantic structures, de- scribed in greater detail in Dale (1989b).
THE UNIF ICAT ION GRAMMAR Once the required surface semantic structure has been constructed, this is passed to a unification 73 $S = ind .= = z atatua= 8era epee = .

In EPICURE, the grammar consists of phrase structure rules annotated with path equa- tions which determine the relationships between semantic units and syntactic units: the path equa- tions specify arbitrary constituents (either com- plex or atomic) of feature structures.
There is insufficient space here to show the en- tire NP grammar, but we provide some representa- tive rules in figure 9 (although these rules are ex- pressed here in a PATR-Iike formalism, within EPI- CURE they are encoded as PROLOG definite clause grammar (DCG) rules (Clocksin and Mellish 1981)).
Applying these rules to the surface semantic struc- tures described above results in the generation of the appropriate surface linguistic strings.
CONCLUSION In this paper, we have described the processes used in EPICURE to produce noun phrase referring ex- pressions.
EPICURE is implemented in C-PROLOG running under UNIX.
The algorithms used in the system permit the generation of a wide range of pronominal forms, one-anaphoric forms and full noun phrase structures, including partitives and pseudo-partitives.
