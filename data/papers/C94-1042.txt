We con- sider the types of errors which arise in creating such a lexicon, and how such errors can be measured and controlled.
1 Goal The goal of the (:omlex Syntax project is to create a moderately-broad-coverage lexicon recording the syn- tactic features of gnglist; words for purposes of cou> putational anguage analysis.
This dictionary is be- ing developed at New York University and is to he distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortimn, to be freely usable for both research and commercial pur- poses by members of the Consortium.
In order to ineet the needs of a wide range of an~> lyzers, we have inchlded a rich set of syntactic features and haw~ aimed to characterize these Datures in a rela- tively theory-neutral way.
In l)articnlar, the feature set is more detailed than those of the major commercial dictionaries, such ;us the Oxford Adwmced Learners Dictionary (OALI)) [d] and the Longnum Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) [8], which haw~ I)een widely used as a source o[ lexical i,,for,,lal, ioil ill ];lll- guage analyzers.

2 Structure Ti le  word list was derived fion, the file prepared by Prof. Roger Mitten from the Oxford Adwn,ced Learners Dictionary, and contains about 38,000 head forms, although some purely British terms have been omitted, loach entry is organized as a nested set of typed feature-vahle ists.

be readily mapped into other hwn,s, such as SC, MI,- marked text, if desired.
SOllie sauil)le dicticl l ,ary entries are shown ilt F igure 1.
The first syml/ol gives the part of speech; a word with several parts of speech will have several dictionary entries, one for each part of speech.
Each e,itry has all :orth foati lre, g iv ing the base fO,lfl of  ti le word, No,ins, verbs, and adjectiw~s with irregular Inorphology will liave featt,res for the irregular fo,.iris :plural, :past, :past- part, etc.
Words which take con-,i)leirients will have a subcatego,ization (:sube) [eat,ire.
For exaniple> the verb "ai )andon" eali occur with a IlOllri phrase followed by a prepositional phrase with tim preposition "to" (e.g., "1 abandoned hii,i to the linguists.")
or with just a ,lOll,, phrase comple i f ient  ( "  [  aballdone(l the shill.").
Other syntactic features are recorded under :features.
For example, the noun "abandon" is marked as (count- able :pval ("wlth")), indicating that it must appear in the singular with a deter,niner unless it is preceded by the preposZion "with".
2.1 Subcategor i za t ion We have paid p~uticular attention to providing detailed subcategorization information (information about complement s ructure), both for verbs and for tllose nouns and adjectives which do take cmnl)lements.
In order to insure the COml)leteness of our codes, we studied the codiug e)ul)loyed by s(weral other u,ajor texicous, includh,g (,he Ihandeis Verh Lexlcolt 2, the A(JQIJII,EX Prc, ject [10], the NYU Linguistic String lroject [9], the OALI), and IA)OCI], a, nd, whenever feasiMe, haw~ sought to incorporate distinctions made in any  of  these all(tie,tortes.
()ur resu l t ing  feature sys- ten, includes 92 subcategorization features Ibr w~rbs, 14 for adjectives, and 9 for llO,,ns.
These features record dilforences in grammatical functional structure as well as constituent structure.
In particular, tl,ey Calfl.ure four different ypes of control: subject control, object control, variable control, and arbitrary control.
Fur- thermore, the notation allows us to indicate that verl) Irlay haw~ dill>rent control features for different comlflement structmes~ or ewm for dilrerent preposi- tions within the complement.
We record, for example, that "blame ... on" involves arbitrary control ("lie 2 l)ewdoped by J.

The names fl)r the ditferent complmnent types are b~sed on the conventions used ill the Ih-ancleis wwb lexicon, where each COml)Mneut is designated by tl,, names of its constituents, together with a few tags to indicate things such as control phenonleua.
Earh corn plement ype is formally defined by n fr;uue (see Fig-.
Tile frame includes the constituellt structure, :cs, tile grammatical structure, :gs, one cu, nlme :fea- tures, and one or more ex~unples, :ex.
Tile constit.uent structure lists the constituents in sequence; the gram- marital structure indicates the functional role played by e,~ch c(mstituent.
The elemenl.s of the constitueut structure are indexed, and these indices are referenced in the grammatical structure field (in up-.frames, I.he index "1" in the grammatical structures always refers to tile surface subject of tile verb).
Three verb frames are shown ill Figure 2.

Tim second aim third frames I)oth represent infinitiwd conq~lemel,ts, aim dillre only in their filnctiona[ structure.
The to-ingsc frame iv f(~r subject-cm~trol verbs,  verbs for which the surface subject is the flmctional subject of both the nlatrix ;tad embedded chmses.
The notation :subject 1 in the :cs tleld indicates that the surface subject is the sub- ject of tile enlbedded clause, while the :subject 1 ill the :gs Iield indicates that it is the subject of the matrix clause.
The indication :features (:control subject) pro- vides this [nforlnation redundantly; we include I)oth indications in case one is more collvelliellt for i);trticu - ltu" dictionary users.
The to-ingrs flatne is for raising- to-subject verbs - - verbs for which the surface subject is tile functional subject only of the embedded c];tuso.
The functional subject position in the matrix clause is unlilled, as indicated by the notation :gs (:subject () :corap 2).

4 Types  and Sources of Er ror As ])art of the process of refining the dictionary and as- suring its quality, we have spent considerable r sources on reviewing dictionary entries and on occasion have had sections coded by two or even four of the elves.
This process has allowed us to make some analysis of the sources and types of error in the lexicon, and how these errors might be reduced.
can divide the sources of error and inconsistency into four classes: 1. errors of  class i f icat ion:  where an instance of a word is improperly analyzed, and in particular where the words following a verb are not properly identified with regard to complement type.
SI)e- eific types of problems include misclassifying ad- juncts as arguments (or vice versa) and identifying the wrong control features.
Our primary defenses against such errors have been a steady refinement of tile feature deseril)tions in ollr nlanlla] and rel;- ular grou I) review sessions with all the elves.
Ill particular, we have developed detailed criteria for making adjunct/argument distinctiolis [O].
A 1)reliminary study, conducted on examples (drawn at random from a corpus not used for our concordance) of verbs beginning with "j", in- dicated that elves were consistent 93% to 94% of the time in labeling argument/adjunct distinc- tions following our criteria and, in these eases, rarely disagreed on the subcategorization.
I  more than half of the cases where there was disagree- then(, the elves separately flagged these as drill- cult, ambiguous, or figurative uses of the verbs (and therefore would probably not use them its the basis for assigning lexical features).
The agree- ment rate for examl)les whicti were not flagged was 96% to 98%.
2. on i i t ted  features :  where an ell omits a Dature because it is not suggested by an example in the concordance, a citation ill the dictionary, or the elfs introspection.
In order to get an est.ilnate of the niag, itude of this problem we decided to es- tablish a measure of coverage or "recall" for the subcategorization Dal.ures assigned by our elves.
"lb do this, we tagged the first 150 "j" verbs from a randomly selected corpus from a part of the San Diego Mercury which was not inchlded in our concordance and then compared the dictio- nary entries created by our lexicographers against the tagged eorptis.
The restllts of this colnparison are sliown in Figure 3.
~Phe "(~omplements only" is the percentage of in- stances in the corpus covered by the subcatego- rization tags assigned by the elves and does not include the identification of i~rly l)rel)ositions or adverbs.
llie "(~oinl~lements only" would corre- spond rougllly to the type of inforinal, ion provided by OALI)  and l,I.

Ttie two COlllliiliS of (igiiies iUlder "Ci)ni- l)lenients-t-I>rel>ositions/lari.icles , show tim re- suits with and without the enumeration of dhoe- tional l)reposltlons.
We have recently changed ollr approach to i, he classification of verbs (like "riin > "send >>, "jog >, "wall:, " juml;  )  wliieh take a long list of direc- tional l)rel)ositlons, by l)roviding our entering pro- grain with a P-D/I{ option on the preposition llst.
lhis option will automatically assign a list of di- rectional prepositions to the verb and thus will saw.
tirne and eliminate errors of rriissing prepo- sitions.

a prel)osition list that is a little rich for a given verb I)ut we have decided to err on the side of a slight overgeneration rather thall risk missing ally prel)ositions which actually occur.
As you can see, the removal of the ILl)IlLs from consideration im- proves the in(lividual elf scores.
The elf union score is the union, of the lexical en- tries for all fcmr elves.
These are certainly nuln- bets to be proud of, but realistically, having the verbs clone four sel)arate times is not I)ractical.
llowew~r, in our original proposal we stated that because of the complexity of the verb entries we wouhl like to have them done twice.
As can be seeil in l:igure 5, with two passes we su(ce,,d hi raising individual percentages in all cases.
We would like to make clear that evell in tim two cases where our individuM lexicographers miss 18% and 13% of the complements, there was only one instance in which this might have resulted in the inability to parse a sentence.
This was a miss- ing intransitNe.
Otherwise, the missed cOnll)le- rnents wouhl have been analyzed as adjuncts ince they were a combination of prepositional phrases and adverbials with one case of a suhordinal.e ccm- j line(ion ~as".
We endeavored to make a comparison with LDOCE on the measurement.
This was a bit dif- ficult since LDOCE lacks some con,plements we have and combines others, not always consistently.
For instance, our PP roughly corresponds to either 1,9 (our P l  /a l )V l  )  or l)rep/adv + T1 (e.g.
+ TI )  (our II/IAI{;F-NP) but in some cases a I )relmsit ion is ment ioned but  the verb is classified as iIltr~tllSii, iVe.

In ,~xl, ending the corpus, we h&ve limited mlrselves to texts which would lie readily awdlable I,o nlenlliers of the l,inguistic I)ata Consortium.
exl:e.ss ft~atules: when ;m elf assigns a spurious feature throu.gh incorrect extrapolation or analo.gy from available xamples or introspection.
Because of our desire Io obtain relatively complete foatllre sets, even figr infrequent verl)s, we have pernfit- 271 ted elves to extrapolate from the citations fotmd.
Such a process is bound to be less certain than the assignment of features from extant examples.
Ilowever, this problem does not appear to be very severe.
A review of tile "j" verb entries produced by all four elves indicates that the fraction of spu- rious entries ranges from 2% to 6%.
d. fl~zzy features:  feature assignment is defined in terms of the acceptability of words in particular syntactic frames.
Acceptability, however, is often not absolute but a matter of degree.
A verb may occur primarily with particular complements, but will be "acceptable" with others.
This problem is eompmmded by words which take on particular features only in special contexts.
Thus, we dont ordinarily think of "dead" as be- ing gradable (*"Fred is more dead than Mary.
"), but we do say "deader than a door nail".
It is also compounded by our decision not to make sense distinctions initially.
For examl)le, many words which are countable (require a determiner before the singular form) also have a generic sense in which the determiner is not required (*"Fred bought apple."
but "Apple is a wonderflfl fla- vor.").
For each such problematic feature we have prepared gnidelines for the elves, but these still require considerable discretion on their part.
Fhese problems have emphasized for ns tbe impof tanee of developing a tagged corpus in conjunction with the dictionary, so that frequency of occurrence of a feature (and frequency by text type) will be avail- able.
We have done stone preliminary tagging in par- aim with the completion of our initial dictionary.
We expect to start tagging in earnest in early summmer.
Our plan is to begin by tagging verbs in the Brown corpus, in order to be able to correlate our tagging with the word sense tagging being done by tim Word- Net group on the same corpus [7].
We expect to tag at least 25 instances of each verb.
If there are not enough occurrences in tim Brown Corlms , we will use examples from the same sources as our extended cor- pus (s~e above).
