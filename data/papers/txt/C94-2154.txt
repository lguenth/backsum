in this pa,per, we argue tha, t type inferencing incorrectly implements a.pl)rolwiateness specifica.tions for typed [ea.ture structures, promote a combina.tion of l;ype resolution and unfilling a,s a. correct a.nd ef'~ ticient Mternative, and consider the expressive limits of this a.lterna.tive approa.ch.
!['hroughout, we use feature cooccurence restrictions as illustration and linguistic motivation.
Unification lbrmMisms ma.y be either un-typed (DCC~s, PATRII, 1,F(;) or typed (npsG).
A m~L,ior reason for adding types to ~ forma,lism is to express restrictions on fea.ture cooccurences a.s in (;l's(:: [5] in order to rule out nonexista.nt tyl)es of objects.
For example, there a.re no verbs which have the [km.ture +R. The simplest way to express such restrictions is by mea.ns of a.n a.ppropria.teness pa.r-tim flmction Approp: Type × Feat ~ Type.
With such a.n a.pl)rol)riatleness specifica.- tion lrla.tly Sllch restrictioi,s may be expressed, though no restrictions involving reentrancies ma.y be expressed.
In this pal)er, we will first in §2 survey the range of type eonstra.ints tha.t ma.y be expressed with just a. type hiera.rchy and *']'he resea.rch pl'eS(!lllL('d ill |,his; paper was pay tia.lly sponsored hy '[kfilprojekt B4 "(;onsl.rahH.s on Grammar fl~r Efficient Ck:neration" of the Soi,der forschungsbereich 340 of the Deutsche ["orschungsgemeinscha, ft.

Then in ~3, we discuss how such type cons|fronts linty be mainta.ined under unification as exemplilied in the na.tura.1 language D~rs- ing/generation system '.l'ro]l [7].
1 Unlike previous systems such as ALl,:, Troll does not employ a.ny type infereneing, inste~M, a, limited amount of named disjunction ([1 1], [12], [6])is introduced to record type resol u tion possibilities.
The a.lnount of dis- junction is a.lso kept small by the technique of unlilli,g described in [9].
This strategy a.ctua.lly ma.inta.ins apl)ropri~tteness conditions in some ca.ses in which a. type in-ferencing stra.tegy would fa.il, l)'inMly, in §4, we discuss the possibilities for genera lizillg this a.pl)roa.ch to ha.ndle a bro~Mer r~tnge of constra.ints, including constraints inw)lving reentran cies.
As discussed iu Gerdemann ,~ King [8], one ca.n view a.pl}rol)ria.teness CO[lditions as (lelining GPSG style fea,1;tl re cooccurence restrict:ions (FCRs).
In [8], we divided FCRs into co,j,,ctive and di.q,,~ctive ct~sses.

well-typable iff the feature structure subsumes a well-typed feature structure, in ALl.:, type infereneing is employed to ensure that all feature structures are well-typable--in fact, all feature structures are well typed.
Unfortunately, well-typability is not sufficient to ensure that disjunctive FCRs are satisfied.
Consider, For exam- pie, our encoding of the disjunctive FCR p and suppose that 99 is the fe, ature structure t[f : +,9 : -].
90 is well-typed, and hence trivially well-typable.
Unfortunately, 99 vb elates the encoded disjunctive FCR p. The only way one could interpret ~ as well-formed.
By contrast, the Troll system described in this paper has an etfeetive algorithm f<>r deciding well-formedness, which is based on the idea of efficiently representing disjunctive possibilities within the feature structure, Call a well-typed feature structure in which all nodes are labelled with species a resolved feature structure and call a set of resolved feature structures that have the same underlying graph (that is, they differ only in their node labellings) a disjunctive resolved feature structure.
We write fS, ~vf8 and 'D~.)c$ for the collections of feature structures, resolved feature structures and disjunctive resolved feature structures respectively.
Say that F'E RFS is a resolvant of F E FS iff F and F' have the same underlying graph and F subsumes F'.
Let type resolution be the total function R:->DRFS such that R(F) is the set of all resolvants of F. Guided by the partition and all-or-nothing conditions, King [13] has formulated a semantics of feature structures and developed a notion of a satisfiable feature structure such that F E FS is satisfiable iff R(F) 0.
T$ is satisfial~le if[' 7~(F) 7 ~ (7).
C, erdemann ,% King [8] have also shown that a feature strtlcture l]leets all encoded FCRs ifl" the feature structure is satisfiable.
The Troll system, which is based on this idea, effectively inqflements type resolution.
Why does type resohttion succeed where.
type inferencing fails?
Consider again the encoding of p and the feature structure 9~.
Loosely speaking, the appropriateness sl)eeifieations for type t encode the part of p that sta, tes that an object of tyl)e t deserves features f and g, both with boolean vahles.
However, the appropriateness specifications for the speci- ate sul)types t' and t" of type t encode the part of p that states that these val-lies lnust agree.
Well-typability only considers species if forced to.
In the case of ~, well-typability can be estahlished by consklering type t alone, without the l)artition condition forcing one to find a well-typed species subsumed hy t. Consequently, well-tyl)ahility overlooks the part offl exehisively encoded by the ai)propriateness specifications for t' and t".
Type resolution, on the other hand, always considers species.
Thus, type resolving 9o cannot overlook the part of p exclusively encoded by tile appropriateness specifications for t' and t'.
APPROPRIATENES S CONDITIONS A very important property of the class of DRFS is that they are closed under unification, i.e., if F and F'E DRFS then F U F' E DRFS.4 Given this property, it would in principle he possible to use the disjunctive resolved feature structures in an implementation without any additional type inferencing procedure to maintain satisfiability.
It would, of course, not be very efficient to work with such large disjunctions of feature structures.

handle this limited class of reentrancy- constraints.
It seems then, that the class of constraints that can be expressed by appropriateness conditions corresponds closely to the class of constraints that can be efficiently preeompiled.
We take this as a justification for appropriateness formalisms in general.
It makes sense to ~d)straet out the efficiently processable constraints and then allow another mechalfiSm, such as attachments of definite clauses, to express more complex constraints.
