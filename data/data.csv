(Kawaba et al., 2008) use a Wikipedia-based model to perform sentiment analysis of blog posts.', 'They find, for example, that English blog posts about the Nintendo Wii often relate to a hack, which cannot be mentioned in Japanese posts due to Japanese intellectual property law.', 'Similarly, posts about whaling often use (positive) nationalist language in Japanese and (negative) environmentalist language in English.', 'The polylingual topic model (PLTM) is an extension of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) for modeling polylingual document tuples.', 'Each tuple is a set of documents that are loosely equivalent to each other, but written in different languages, e.g., corresponding Wikipedia articles in French, English and German.', 'PLTM assumes that the documents in a tuple share the same tuple-specific distribution over topics.', 'This is unlike LDA, in which each document is assumed to have its own document-specific distribution over topics.', 'Additionally, PLTM assumes that each “topic” consists of a set of discrete distributions over words—one for each language l = 1, ... , L. In other words, rather than using a single set of topics Φ = {φ1, ... , φT}, as in LDA, there are L sets of language-specific topics, Φ1, ... , ΦL, each of which is drawn from a language-specific symmetric Dirichlet with concentration parameter βl.', 'Anew document tuple w = (w1, ... , wL) is generated by first drawing a tuple-specific topic distribution from an asymmetric Dirichlet prior with concentration parameter α and base measure m: Then, for each language l, a latent topic assignment is drawn for each token in that language: Finally, the observed tokens are themselves drawn using the language-specific topic parameters: wl ∼ P(wl  |zl,Φl) = 11n φlwl |zl .', '(3) The graphical model is shown in figure 1.', ""Given a corpus of training and test document tuples—W and W',

for all other tokens in the tuple, while (Nt)\\l,n is the number of occurrences of topic t in the tuple, excluding zln, the variable being resampled.', 'Our first set of experiments focuses on document tuples that are known to consist of direct translations.', 'In this case, we can be confident that the topic distribution is genuinely shared across all languages.', 'Although direct translations in multiple languages are relatively rare (in contrast with comparable documents), we use direct translations to explore the characteristics of the model.', 'The EuroParl corpus consists of parallel texts in eleven western European languages: Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese and Swedish.', 'These texts consist of roughly a decade of proceedings of the European parliament.', 'For our purposes we use alignments at the speech level rather than the sentence level, as in many translation tasks using this corpus.', 'We also remove the twenty-five most frequent word types for efficiency reasons.', 'The remaining collection consists of over 121 million words.', 'Details by language are shown in Table 1.', 'ES otros otras otro otra

initialized to the uniform distribution.', 'Hyperparameters αm are re-estimated every 10 Gibbs iterations.', 'Figure 2 shows the most probable words in all languages for four example topics, from PLTM with 400 topics.', 'The first topic contains words relating to the European Central Bank.', 'This topic provides an illustration of the variation in technical terminology captured by PLTM, including the wide array of acronyms used by different languages.', 'The second topic, concerning children, demonstrates the variability of everyday terminology: although the four Romance languages are closely related, they use etymologically unrelated words for children.', '(Interestingly, all languages except Greek and Finnish use closely related words for “youth” or “young” in a separate topic.)', 'The third topic demonstrates differences in inflectional variation.', 'English and the Romance languages use only singular and plural versions of “objective.” The other Germanic languages include compound words, while Greek and Finnish are dominated by inflected variants of the same lexical item.', 'The final topic demonstrates that PLTM effectively clusters “syntactic” words, as well as more semantically specific nouns, adjectives and verbs.', 'Although the topics in figure 2 seem highly focused, it is interesting to ask whether the model is genuinely learning mixtures of topics or simply assigning entire document tuples to single topics.', 'To answer this question, we compute the posterior probability of each topic in each tuple under the trained model.', 'If the model assigns all tokens in a tuple to a single topic, the maximum posterior topic probability for that tuple will be near to 1.0.', 'If the model assigns topics uniformly, the maximum topic probability will be near 1/T.', 'We compute histograms of these maximum topic probabilities for T ∈ {50,100, 200, 400, 800}.', 'For clarity, rather than overlaying five histograms, figure 3 shows the histograms converted into smooth curves using a kernel density estimator.1 Although there is a small bump around 1.0 (for extremely short documents, e.g., “Applause”), values are generally closer to, but greater than, 1/T.', 'Maximum topic probability in document Although the posterior distribution over topics for each tuple is not concentrated on one topic, it is worth checking that this is not simply because the model is assigning a single topic to the 1We use the R density function. tokens in each of the languages.', 'Although the model does not distinguish between topic assignment variables within a given document tuple (so it is technically incorrect to speak of different posterior distributions over topics for different documents in a given tuple), we can nevertheless divide topic assignment variables between languages and use them to estimate a Dirichlet-multinomial posterior distribution for each language in each tuple.', 'For each tuple we can then calculate the JensenShannon divergence (the average of the KL divergences between each distribution and a mean distribution) between these distributions.', 'Figure 4 shows the density of these divergences for different numbers of topics.', 'As with the previous figure, there are a small number of documents that contain only one topic in all languages, and thus have zero divergence.', 'These tend to be very short, formulaic parliamentary responses, however.', 'The vast majority of divergences are relatively low (1.0 indicates no overlap in topics between languages in a given document tuple) indicating that, for each tuple, the model is not simply assigning all tokens in a particular language to a single topic.', 'As the number of topics increases, greater variability in topic distributions causes divergence to increase.', 'Smoothed histograms of inter−language JS divergence A topic model specifies a probability distribution over documents, or in the case of PLTM, document tuples.', ""Given a set of training document tuples, PLTM can be used to obtain posterior estimates of Φ', ... , ΦL and αm."", 'The probability of previously unseen held-out document tuples given these estimates can then be computed.', 'The higher the probability of the held-out document tuples, the better the generalization ability of the model.', 'Analytically calculating the probability of a set of held-out document tuples given Φ1, ... , ΦL and αm is intractable, due to the summation over an exponential number of topic assignments for these held-out documents.', 'However, recently developed methods provide efficient, accurate estimates of this probability.', 'We use the “left-to-right” method of (Wallach et al., 2009).', 'We perform five estimation runs for each document and then calculate standard errors using a bootstrap method.', 'Table 2 shows the log probability of held-out data in nats per word for PLTM and LDA, both trained with 200 topics.', 'There is substantial variation between languages.', 'Additionally, the predictive ability of PLTM is consistently slightly worse than that of (monolingual) LDA.', 'It is important to note, however, that these results do not imply that LDA should be preferred over PLTM—that choice depends upon the needs of the modeler.', 'Rather, these results are intended as a quantitative analysis of the difference between the two models.', 'As the number of topics is increased, the word counts per topic become very sparse in monolingual LDA models, proportional to the size of the vocabulary.', 'Figure 5 shows the proportion of all tokens in English and Finnish assigned to each topic under LDA and PLTM with 800 topics.', 'More than 350 topics in the Finnish LDA model have zero tokens assigned to them, and almost all tokens are assigned to the largest 200 topics.', 'English has a larger tail, with non-zero counts in all but 16 topics.', 'In contrast, PLTM assigns a significant number of tokens to almost all 800 topics, in very similar proportions in both languages.', 'PLTM topics therefore have a higher granularity – i.e., they are more specific.', 'This result is important: informally, we have found that increasing the granularity of topics correlates strongly with user perceptions of the utility of a topic model.', 'An important application for polylingual topic modeling is to use small numbers of comparable document tuples to link topics in larger collections of distinct, non-comparable documents in multiple languages.', 'For example, a journal might publish papers in English, French, German and Italian.', 'No paper is exactly comparable to any other paper, but they are all roughly topically similar.', 'If we wish to perform topic-based bibliometric analysis, it is vital to be able to track the same topics across all languages.', 'One simple way to achieve this topic alignment is to add a small set of comparable document tuples that provide sufficient “glue” to bind the topics together.', 'Continuing with the example above, one might extract a set of connected Wikipedia articles related to the focus of the journal and then train PLTM on a joint corpus consisting of journal papers and Wikipedia articles.', 'In order to simulate this scenario we create a set of variations of the EuroParl corpus by treating some documents as if they have no parallel/comparable texts – i.e., we put each of these documents in a single-document tuple.', 'To do this, we divide the corpus W into two sets of document tuples: a “glue” set G and a “separate” set S such that |G |/ |W |= p. In other words, the proportion of tuples in the corpus that are treated as “glue” (i.e., placed in G) is p. For every tuple in S, we assign each document in that tuple to a new singledocument tuple.', 'By doing this, every document in S has its own distribution over topics, independent of any other documents.', 'Ideally, the “glue” documents in g will be sufficient to align the topics across languages, and will cause comparable documents in S to have similar distributions over topics even though they are modeled independently.', 'FR russie tch´etch´enie union avec russe r´egion IT ho presidente mi perch´e relazione votato lang Topics at P = 0.25 DE rußland russland russischen tschetschenien ukraine EN russia russian chechnya cooperation region belarus FR russie tch´etch´enie avec russe russes situation IT russia unione cooperazione cecenia regione russa We train PLTM with 100 topics on corpora with p E 10.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5}.', 'We use 1000 iterations of Gibbs sampling with Q = 0.01.', 'Hyperparameters αm are re-estimated every 10 iterations.', 'We calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the topic distributions for each pair of individual documents in S that were originally part of the same tuple prior to separation.', 'The lower the divergence, the more similar the distributions are to each other.', 'From the results in figure 4, we know that leaving all document tuples intact should result in a mean JS divergence of less than 0.1.', 'Table 3 shows mean JS divergences for each value of p. As expected, JS divergence is greater than that obtained when all tuples are left intact.', 'Divergence drops significantly when the proportion of “glue” tuples increases from 0.01 to 0.25.', 'Example topics for p = 0.01 and p = 0.25 are shown in table 4.', 'At p = 0.01 (1% “glue” documents), German and French both include words relating to Russia, while the English and Italian word distributions appear locally consistent but unrelated to Russia.', 'At p = 0.25, the top words for all four languages are related to Russia.', 'These results demonstrate that PLTM is appropriate for aligning topics in corpora that have only a small subset of comparable documents.', 'One area for future work is to explore whether initialization techniques or better representations of topic co-occurrence might result in alignment of topics with a smaller proportion of comparable texts.', 'Although the PLTM is clearly not a substitute for a machine translation system—it has no way to represent syntax or even multi-word phrases—it is clear from the examples in figure 2 that the sets of high probability words in different languages for a given topic are likely to include translations.', 'We therefore evaluate the ability of the PLTM to generate bilingual lexica, similar to other work in unsupervised translation modeling (Haghighi et al., 2008).', 'In the early statistical translation model work at IBM, these representations were called “cepts,” short for concepts (Brown et al., 1993).', 'We evaluate sets of high-probability words in each topic and multilingual “synsets” by comparing them to entries in human-constructed bilingual dictionaries, as done by Haghighi et al. (2008).', 'Unlike previous work (Koehn and Knight, 2002), we evaluate all words, not just nouns.', 'We collected bilingual lexica mapping English words to German, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch and Swedish.', 'Each lexicon is a set of pairs consisting of an English word and a translated word, 1we, wt}.', 'We do not consider multi-word terms.', 'We expect that simple analysis of topic assignments for sequential words would yield such collocations, but we leave this for future work.', 'For every topic t we select a small number K of the most probable words in English (e) and in each “translation” language (E): Wte and Wtt, respectively.', 'We then add the Cartesian product of these sets for every topic to a set of candidate translations C. We report the number of elements of C that appear in the reference lexica.', 'Results for K = 1, that is, considering only the single most probable word for each language, are shown in figure 6.', 'Precision at this level is relatively high, above 50% for Spanish, French and Italian with T = 400 and 800.', 'Many of the candidate pairs that were not in the bilingual lexica were valid translations (e.g.', 'EN “comitology” and IT lang Topics at P = 0.01 “comitalogia”) that simply were not in the lexica.', 'We also do not count morphological variants: the model finds EN “rules” and DE “vorschriften,” but the lexicon contains only “rule” and “vorschrift.” Results remain strong as we increase K. With K = 3, T = 800, 1349 of the 7200 candidate pairs for Spanish appeared in the lexicon. topic in different languages translations of each other?', 'The number of such pairs that appear in bilingual lexica is shown on the y-axis.', 'For T = 800, the top English and Spanish words in 448 topics were exact translations of one another.', 'In addition to enhancing lexicons by aligning topic-specific vocabulary, PLTM may also be useful for adapting machine translation systems to new domains by finding translations or near translations in an unstructured corpus.', 'These aligned document pairs could then be fed into standard machine translation systems as training data.', 'To evaluate this scenario, we train PLTM on a set of document tuples from EuroParl, infer topic distributions for a set of held-out documents, and then measure our ability to align documents in one language with their translations in another language.', 'It is not necessarily clear that PLTM will be effective at identifying translations.', 'In finding a lowdimensional semantic representation, topic models deliberately smooth over much of the variation present in language.', 'We are therefore interested in determining whether the information in the document-specific topic distributions is sufficient to identify semantically identical documents.', 'We begin by dividing the data into a training set of 69,550 document tuples and a test set of 17,435 document tuples.', 'In order to make the task more difficult, we train a relatively coarse-grained PLTM with 50 topics on the training set.', 'We then use this model to infer topic distributions for each of the 11 documents in each of the held-out document tuples using a method similar to that used to calculate held-out probabilities (Wallach et al., 2009).', 'Finally, for each pair of languages (“query” and “target”) we calculate the difference between the topic distribution for each held-out document in the query language and the topic distribution for each held-out document in the target language.', 'We use both Jensen-Shannon divergence and cosine distance.', 'For each document in the query language we rank all documents in the target language and record the rank of the actual translation.', 'Results averaged over all query/target language pairs are shown in figure 7 for Jensen-Shannon divergence.', 'Cosine-based rankings are significantly worse.', 'It is important to note that the length of documents matters.', 'As noted before, many of the documents in the EuroParl collection consist of short, formulaic sentences.', 'Restricting the query/target pairs to only those with query and target documents that are both longer than 50 words results in significant improvement and reduced variance: the average proportion of query documents for which the true translation is ranked highest goes from 53.9% to 72.7%.', 'Performance continues to improve with longer documents, most likely due to better topic inference.', 'Results vary by language.', 'Table 5 shows results for all target languages with English as a query language.', 'Again, English generally performs better with Romance languages than Germanic languages.', 'Directly parallel translations are rare in many languages and can be extremely expensive to produce.', 'However, the growth of the web, and in particular Wikipedia, has made comparable text corpora – documents that are topically similar but are not direct translations of one another – considerably more abundant than true parallel corpora.', 'In this section, we explore two questions relating to comparable text corpora and polylingual topic modeling.', 'First, we explore whether comparable document tuples support the alignment of fine-grained topics, as demonstrated earlier using parallel documents.', 'This property is useful for building machine translation systems as well as for human readers who are either learning new languages or analyzing texts in languages they do not know.', 'Second, because comparable texts may not use exactly the same topics, it becomes crucially important to be able to characterize differences in topic prevalence at the document level (do different languages have different perspectives on the same article?) and at the language-wide level (which topics do particular languages focus on?).', 'We downloaded XML copies of all Wikipedia articles in twelve different languages: Welsh, German, Greek, English, Farsi, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Italian, Polish, Russian and Turkish.', 'These versions of Wikipedia were selected to provide a diverse range of language families, geographic areas, and quantities of text.', 'We preprocessed the data by removing tables, references, images and info-boxes.', 'We dropped all articles in non-English languages that did not link to an English article.', 'In the English version of Wikipedia we dropped all articles that were not linked to by any other language in our set.', 'For efficiency, we truncated each article to the nearest word after 1000 characters and dropped the 50 most common word types in each language.', 'Even with these restrictions, the size of the corpus is 148.5 million words.', 'We present results for a PLTM with 400 topics.', '1000 Gibbs sampling iterations took roughly four days on one CPU with current hardware.', 'As with EuroParl, we can calculate the JensenShannon divergence between pairs of documents within a comparable document tuple.', 'We can then average over all such document-document divergences for each pair of languages to get an overall “disagreement” score between languages.', 'Interestingly, we find that almost all languages in our corpus, including several pairs that have historically been in conflict, show average JS divergences of between approximately 0.08 and 0.12 for T = 400, consistent with our findings for EuroParl translations.', 'Subtle differences of sentiment may be below the granularity of the model.

topics, we calculated the proportion of tokens in each language assigned to each topic.', 'Figure 8 represents the estimated probabilities of topics given a specific language.', 'Competitive

10,D10-1044,Discriminative Instance Weighting for Domain Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation,"['We describe a new approach to SMT adaptation that weights out-of-domain phrase pairs according to their relevance to the target domain, determined by both how similar to it they appear to be, and whether they belong to general language or not.', 'This extends previous work on discriminative weighting by using a finer granularity, focusing on the properties of instances rather than corpus components, and using a simpler training procedure.', 'We incorporate instance weighting into a mixture-model framework, and find that it yields consistent improvements over a wide range of baselines.', 'Domain adaptation is a common concern when optimizing empirical NLP applications.', 'Even when there is training data available in the domain of interest, there is often additional data from other domains that could in principle be used to improve performance.', 'Realizing gains in practice can be challenging, however, particularly when the target domain is distant from the background data.', 'For developers of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems, an additional complication is the heterogeneous nature of SMT components (word-alignment model, language model, translation model, etc.', '), which precludes a single universal approach to adaptation.', 'In this paper we study the problem of using a parallel corpus from a background domain (OUT) to improve performance on a target domain (IN) for which a smaller amount of parallel training material—though adequate for reasonable performance—is also available.', 'This is a standard adaptation problem for SMT.', 'It is difficult when IN and OUT are dissimilar, as they are in the cases we study.', 'For simplicity, we assume that OUT is homogeneous.', 'The techniques we develop can be extended in a relatively straightforward manner to the more general case when OUT consists of multiple sub-domains.', 'There is a fairly large body of work on SMT adaptation.', 'We introduce several new ideas.', 'First, we aim to explicitly characterize examples from OUT as belonging to general language or not.', 'Previous approaches have tried to find examples that are similar to the target domain.', 'This is less effective in our setting, where IN and OUT are disparate.', 'The idea of distinguishing between general and domain-specific examples is due to Daum´e and Marcu (2006), who used a maximum-entropy model with latent variables to capture the degree of specificity.', 'Daum´e (2007) applies a related idea in a simpler way, by splitting features into general and domain-specific versions.', 'This highly effective approach is not directly applicable to the multinomial models used for core SMT components, which have no natural method for combining split features, so we rely on an instance-weighting approach (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) to downweight domain-specific examples in OUT.', 'Within this framework, we use features intended to capture degree of generality, including the output from an SVM classifier that uses the intersection between IN and OUT as positive examples.', 'Our second contribution is to apply instance weighting at the level of phrase pairs.', 'Sentence pairs are the natural instances for SMT, but sentences often contain a mix of domain-specific and general

presence of general phrases like were reported in.', 'Phrase-level granularity distinguishes our work from previous work by Matsoukas et al (2009), who weight sentences according to sub-corpus and genre membership.', 'Finally, we make some improvements to baseline approaches.', 'We train linear mixture models for conditional phrase pair probabilities over IN and OUT so as to maximize the likelihood of an empirical joint phrase-pair distribution extracted from a development set.', 'This is a simple and effective alternative to setting weights discriminatively to maximize a metric such as BLEU.', 'A similar maximumlikelihood approach was used by Foster and Kuhn (2007), but for language models only.', 'For comparison to information-retrieval inspired baselines, eg (L¨u et al., 2007), we select sentences from OUT using language model perplexities from IN.', 'This is a straightforward technique that is arguably better suited to the adaptation task than the standard method of treating representative IN sentences as queries, then pooling the match results.', 'The paper is structured as follows.', 'Section 2 describes our baseline techniques for SMT adaptation, and section 3 describes the instance-weighting approach.', 'Experiments are presented in section 4.', 'Section 5 covers relevant previous work on SMT adaptation, and section 6 concludes.', 'Standard SMT systems have a hierarchical parameter structure: top-level log-linear weights are used to combine a small set of complex features, interpreted as log probabilities, many of which have their own internal parameters and objectives.', 'The toplevel weights are trained to maximize a metric such as BLEU on a small development set of approximately 1000 sentence pairs.', 'Thus, provided at least this amount of IN data is available—as it is in our setting—adapting these weights is straightforward.', 'We focus here instead on adapting the two most important features: the language model (LM), which estimates the probability p(wIh) of a target word w following an ngram h; and the translation models (TM) p(slt) and p(t1s), which give the probability of source phrase s translating to target phrase t, and vice versa.', 'We do not adapt the alignment procedure for generating the phrase table from which the TM distributions are derived.', 'The natural baseline approach is to concatenate data from IN and OUT.', 'Its success depends on the two domains being relatively close, and on the OUT corpus not being so large as to overwhelm the contribution of IN.', 'When OUT is large and distinct, its contribution can be controlled by training separate IN and OUT models, and weighting their combination.', 'An easy way to achieve this is to put the domain-specific LMs and TMs into the top-level log-linear model and learn optimal weights with MERT (Och, 2003).', 'This has the potential drawback of increasing the number of features, which can make MERT less stable (Foster and Kuhn, 2009).', 'Apart from MERT difficulties, a conceptual problem with log-linear combination is that it multiplies feature probabilities, essentially forcing different features to agree on high-scoring candidates.', 'This is appropriate in cases where it is sanctioned by Bayes’ law, such as multiplying LM and TM probabilities, but for adaptation a more suitable framework is often a mixture model in which each event may be generated from some domain.', 'This leads to a linear combination of domain-specific probabilities, with weights in [0, 1], normalized to sum to 1.', 'Linear weights are difficult to incorporate into the standard MERT procedure because they are “hidden” within a top-level probability that represents the linear combination.1 Following previous work (Foster and Kuhn, 2007), we circumvent this problem by choosing weights to optimize corpus loglikelihood, which is roughly speaking the training criterion used by the LM and TM themselves.', 'For the LM, adaptive weights are set as follows: where α is a weight vector containing an element αi for each domain (just IN and OUT in our case), pi are the corresponding domain-specific models, and ˜p(w, h) is an empirical distribution from a targetlanguage training corpus—we used the IN dev set for this.', 'It is not immediately obvious how to formulate an equivalent to equation (1) for an adapted TM, because there is no well-defined objective for learning TMs from parallel corpora.', 'This has led previous workers to adopt ad hoc linear weighting schemes (Finch and Sumita, 2008; Foster and Kuhn, 2007; L¨u et al., 2007).', 'However, we note that the final conditional estimates p(s|t) from a given phrase table maximize the likelihood of joint empirical phrase pair counts over a word-aligned corpus.', 'This suggests a direct parallel to (1): where ˜p(s, t) is a joint empirical distribution extracted from the IN dev set using the standard procedure.2 An alternative form of linear combination is a maximum a posteriori (MAP) combination (Bacchiani et al., 2004).', ""For the TM, this is: where cI(s, t) is the count in the IN phrase table of pair (s, t), po(s|t) is its probability under the OUT TM, and cI(t) = &quot;s, cI(s', t)."", 'This is motivated by taking β po(s|t) to be the parameters of a Dirichlet prior on phrase probabilities, then maximizing posterior estimates p(s|t) given the IN corpus.', 'Intuitively, it places more weight on OUT when less evidence from IN is available.', 'To set β, we used the same criterion as for α, over a dev corpus: The MAP combination was used for TM probabilities only, in part due to a technical difficulty in formulating coherent counts when using standard LM smoothing techniques (Kneser and Ney, 1995).3 Motivated by information retrieval, a number of approaches choose “relevant” sentence pairs from OUT by matching individual source sentences from IN (Hildebrand et al., 2005; L¨u et al., 2007), or individual target hypotheses (Zhao et al., 2004).', 'The matching sentence pairs are then added to the IN corpus, and the system is re-trained.', 'Although matching is done at the sentence level, this information is subsequently discarded when all matches are pooled.', 'To approximate these baselines, we implemented a very simple sentence selection algorithm in which parallel sentence pairs from OUT are ranked by the perplexity of their target half according to the IN language model.', 'The number of top-ranked pairs to retain is chosen to optimize dev-set BLEU score.', 'The sentence-selection approach is crude in that it imposes a binary distinction between useful and non-useful parts of OUT.', 'Matsoukas et al (2009) generalize it by learning weights on sentence pairs that are used when estimating relative-frequency phrase-pair probabilities.', 'The weight on each sentence is a value in [0, 1] computed by a perceptron with Boolean features that indicate collection and genre membership.', 'We extend the Matsoukas et al approach in several ways.', 'First, we learn weights on individual phrase pairs rather than sentences.', 'Intuitively, as suggested by the example in the introduction, this is the right granularity to capture domain effects.', 'Second, rather than relying on a division of the corpus into manually-assigned portions, we use features intended to capture the usefulness of each phrase pair.', 'Finally, we incorporate the instance-weighting model into a general linear combination, and learn weights and mixing parameters simultaneously. where cλ(s, t) is a modified count for pair (s, t) in OUT, u(s|t) is a prior distribution, and y is a prior weight.', 'The original OUT counts co(s, t) are weighted by a logistic function wλ(s, t): To motivate weighting joint OUT counts as in (6), we begin with the “ideal” objective for setting multinomial phrase probabilities 0 = {p(s|t), dst}, which is the likelihood with respect to the true IN distribution pi(s, t).', 'Jiang and Zhai (2007)

make an iterative approximation to expected TER.', 'However, it is robust, efficient, and easy to implement.4 To perform the maximization in (7), we used the popular L-BFGS algorithm (Liu and Nocedal, 1989), which requires gradient information.', 'Dropping the conditioning on 0 for brevity, and letting ¯cλ(s, t) = cλ(s, t) + yu(s|t), and ¯cλ(t) = 4Note that the probabilities in (7) need only be evaluated over the support of ˜p(s, t), which is quite small when this distribution is derived from a dev set.', 'Maximizing (7) is thus much faster than a typical MERT run. where co(s, t) are the counts from OUT, as in (6).', 'This has solutions: where pI(s|t) is derived from the IN corpus using relative-frequency estimates, and po(s|t) is an instance-weighted model derived from the OUT corpus.', 'This combination generalizes (2) and (3): we use either at = a to obtain a fixed-weight linear combination, or at = cI(t)/(cI(t) + 0) to obtain a MAP combination.', 'We model po(s|t) using a MAP criterion over weighted phrase-pair counts: and from the similarity to (5), assuming y = 0, we see that wλ(s, t) can be interpreted as approximating pf(s, t)/po(s, t).', 'The logistic function, whose outputs are in [0, 1], forces pp(s, t) <_ po(s, t).', 'This is not unreasonable given the application to phrase pairs from OUT, but it suggests that an interesting alternative might be to use a plain log-linear weighting function exp(Ei Aifi(s, t)), with outputs in [0, oo].', 'We have not yet tried this.', 'An alternate approximation to (8) would be to let w,\\(s, t) directly approximate pˆI(s, t).', 'With the additional assumption that (s, t) can be restricted to the support of co(s, t), this is equivalent to a “flat” alternative to (6) in which each non-zero co(s, t) is set to one.', 'This variant is tested in the experiments below.', 'A final alternate approach would be to combine weighted joint frequencies rather than conditional estimates, ie: cI(s, t) + w,\\(s, t)co(, s, t), suitably normalized.5 Such an approach could be simulated by a MAP-style combination in which separate 0(t) values were maintained for each t. This would make the model more powerful, but at the cost of having to learn to downweight OUT separately for each t, which we suspect would require more training data for reliable performance.', 'We have not explored this strategy.', 'We used 22 features for the logistic weighting model, divided into two groups: one intended to reflect the degree to which a phrase pair belongs to general language, and one intended to capture similarity to the IN domain.', 'The 14 general-language features embody straightforward cues: frequency, “centrality” as reflected in model scores, and lack of burstiness.', 'They are: 5We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out.', '6One of our experimental settings lacks document boundaries, and we used this approximation in both settings for consistency.', 'The 8 similarity-to-IN features are based on word frequencies and scores from various models trained on the IN corpus: To avoid numerical problems, each feature was normalized by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation.', 'In addition to using the simple features directly, we also trained an SVM classifier with these features to distinguish between IN and OUT phrase pairs.', 'Phrase tables were extracted from the IN and OUT training corpora (not the dev as was used for instance weighting models), and phrase pairs in the intersection of the IN and OUT phrase tables were used as positive examples, with two alternate definitions of negative examples: The classifier trained using the 2nd definition had higher accuracy on a development set.', 'We used it to score all phrase pairs in the OUT table, in order to provide a feature for the instance-weighting model.', 'We carried out translation experiments in two different settings.', 'The first setting uses the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) corpus (Tiedemann, 2009) as IN, and the Europarl (EP) corpus (www.statmt.org/europarl) as OUT, for English/French translation in both directions.', 'The dev and test sets were randomly chosen from the EMEA corpus.', 'Figure 1 shows sample sentences from these domains, which are widely divergent.', 'The second setting uses the news-related subcorpora for the NIST09 MT Chinese to English evaluation8 as IN, and the remaining NIST parallel Chinese/English corpora (UN, Hong Kong Laws, and Hong Kong Hansard) as OUT.', 'The dev corpus was taken from the NIST05 evaluation set, augmented with some randomly-selected material reserved from the training set.', 'The NIST06 and NIST08 evaluation sets were used for testing.', '(Thus the domain of the dev and test corpora matches IN.)', 'Compared to the EMEA/EP setting, the two domains in the NIST setting are less homogeneous and more similar to each other; there is also considerably more IN text available.', 'The corpora for both settings are summarized in table 1.', 'The reference medicine for Silapo is EPREX/ERYPO, which contains epoetin alfa.', 'Le m´edicament de

described in sections 2 and 3.', 'The 1st block contains the simple baselines from section 2.1.', 'The natural baseline (baseline) outperforms the pure IN system only for EMEA/EP fren.', 'Log-linear combination (loglin) improves on this in all cases, and also beats the pure IN system.', 'The 2nd block contains the IR system, which was tuned by selecting text in multiples of the size of the EMEA training corpus, according to dev set performance.', 'This significantly underperforms log-linear combination.', 'The 3rd block contains the mixture baselines.', 'The linear LM (lin lm), TM (lin tm) and MAP TM (map tm) used with non-adapted counterparts perform in all cases slightly worse than the log-linear combination, which adapts both LM and TM components.', 'However, when the linear LM is combined with a linear TM (lm+lin tm) or MAP TM (lm+map TM), the results are much better than a log-linear combination for the EMEA setting, and on a par for NIST.', 'This is consistent with the nature of these two settings: log-linear combination, which effectively takes the intersection of IN and OUT, does relatively better on NIST, where the domains are broader and closer together.',

weighting.', 'It is difficult to directly compare the Matsoukas et al results with ours, since our out-of-domain corpus is homogeneous; given heterogeneous training data, however, it would be trivial to include Matsoukas-style identity features in our instance-weighting model.', 'Although these authors report better gains than ours, they are with respect to a non-adapted baseline.', 'Finally, we note that Jiang’s instance-weighting framework is broader than we have presented above, encompassing among other possibilities the use of unlabelled IN data, which is applicable to SMT settings where source-only IN corpora are available.', 'It is also worth pointing out a connection with Daum´e’s (2007) work that splits each feature into domain-specific and general copies.', 'At first glance, this seems only peripherally related to our work, since the specific/general distinction is made for features rather than instances.', 'However, for multinomial models like our LMs and TMs, there is a one to one correspondence between instances and features, eg the correspondence between a phrase pair (s, t) and its conditional multinomial probability p(s1t).', 'As mentioned above, it is not obvious how to apply Daum´e’s approach to multinomials, which do not have a mechanism for combining split features.', 'Recent work by Finkel and Manning (2009) which re-casts Daum´e’s approach in a

likely tocontain an answer to the question, then a related sentence, which may not be similar to the question itself, is also likely to contain an answer.This idea is captured by the following mixture model, where p(s|q), the score of a sentence s givena question q, is determined as the sum of its relevance to the question (using the same measure asthe baseline described above) and the similarity tothe other sentences in the document cluster: p(s|q) = d rel(s|q)Pz?C rel(z|q) +(1-d)Xv?C sim(s, v)Pz?C sim(z, v) p(v|q) (3) where C is the set of all sentences in the cluster.', 'Thevalue of d,

words in unrestricted text.', 'The model has the advantage that a pre-tagged training corpus is not required.', 'Words are represented by equivalence classes to reduce the number of parameters required and provide an essentially vocabulary-independent model.', 'State chains are used to model selective higher-order conditioning in the model, which obviates the proliferation of parameters attendant in uniformly higher-order models.', 'The structure of the state chains is based on both an analysis of errors and linguistic knowledge.', 'Examples show how word dependency across phrases can be modeled.', 'The determination of part-of-speech categories for words is an important problem in language modeling, because both the syntactic and semantic roles of words depend on their part-of-speech category (henceforth simply termed ""category"").', 'Application areas include speech recognition/synthesis and information retrieval.', 'Several workers have addressed the problem of tagging text.', 'Methods have ranged from locally-operating rules (Greene and Rubin, 1971), to statistical methods (Church, 1989; DeRose, 1988; Garside, Leech and Sampson, 1987; Jelinek, 1985) and back-propagation (Benello, Mackie and Anderson, 1989; Nakamura and Shikano, 1989).', 'The statistical methods can be described in terms of Markov models.', 'States in a model represent categories {cl...c=} (n is the number of different categories used).', 'In a first order model, Ci and Ci_l are random variables denoting the categories of the words at position i and (i - 1) in a text.', 'The transition probability P(Ci = cz ] Ci_~ = %) linking two states cz and cy, represents the probability of category cx following category %.', 'A word at position i is represented by the random variable Wi, which ranges over the vocabulary {w~ ...wv} (v is the number of words in the vocabulary).', 'State-dependent probabilities of the form P(Wi = Wa ] Ci = cz) represent the probability that word Wa is seen, given category c~.', 'For instance, the word ""dog"" can be seen in the states noun and verb, and only has a nonzero probability in those states.', 'A word sequence is considered as being generated from an underlying sequence of categories.', 'Of all the possible category sequences from which a given word sequence can be generated, the one which maximizes the probability of the words is used.', 'The Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967) will find this category sequence.', 'The systems previously mentioned require a pre-tagged training corpus in order to collect word counts or to perform back-propagation.', 'The Brown Corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1982) is a notable example of such a corpus, and is used by many of the systems cited above.', 'An alternative approach taken by Jelinek, (Jelinek, 1985) is to view the training problem in terms of a ""hidden"" Markov model: that is, only the words of the training text are available, their corresponding categories are not known.', 'In this situation, the Baum-Welch algorithm (Baum, 1972) can be used to estimate the model parameters.', 'This has the great advantage of eliminating the pre-tagged corpus.', 'It minimizes the resources required, facilitates experimentation with different word categories, and is easily adapted for use with other languages.', 'The work described here also makes use of a hidden Markov model.', 'One aim of the work is to investigate the quality and performance of models with minimal parameter descriptions.', 'In this regard, word equivalence classes were used (Kupiec, 1989).', 'There it is assumed that the distribution of the use of a word depends on the set of categories it can assume, and words are partitioned accordingly.', 'Thus the words ""play"" and ""touch"" are considered to behave identically, as members of the class noun-or-verb, and ""clay"" and ""zinc""are members of the class noun.', 'This partitioning drastically reduces the number of parameters required in the model, and aids reliable estimation using moderate amounts of training data.', 'Equivalence classes {Eqvl ...Eqvm} replace the words {wl...Wv} (m << v) and P(Eqvi I Ci) replace the parameters P(Wi I Ci).', 'In the 21 category model reported in Kupiec (1989) only 129 equivalence classes were required to cover a 30,000 word dictionary.', 'In fact, the number of equivalence classes is essentially independent of the size of the dictionary, enabling new words to be added without any modification to the model.', 'Obviously, a trade-off is involved.', 'For example, ""dog"" is more likely to be a noun than a verb and ""see"" is more likely to be a verb than a noun.', 'However they are both members of the equivalence class noun-or-verb, and so are considered to behave identically.', 'It is then local word context (embodied in the transition probabilities) which must aid disambiguation of the word.', 'In practice, word context provides significant constraint, so the trade-off appears to be a remarkably favorable one.', 'The Basic Model The development of the model was guided by evaluation against a simple basic model (much of the development of the model was prompted by an analysis of the errors in its hehaviour).', 'The basic model contained states representing the following categories: Determiner Noun Singular Including mass nouns Noun Plural Proper

first-order, fully connected network, each state having a transition to every other state, allowing all possible sequences of categories.', 'The training corpus was a collection of electronic mail messages concerning the design of the Common-Lisp programming language -a somewhat less than ideal representation of English.', 'Many Lisp-specific words were not in the vocabulary, and thus tagged as unknown, however the lisp category was nevertheless created for frequently occurring Lisp symbols in an attempt to reduce bias in the estimation.', 'It is interesting to note that the model performs very well, despite such ""noisy"" training data.', 'The training was sentence-based, and the model was trained using 6,000 sentences from the corpus.', 'Eight iterations of the Baum-Welch algorithm were used.', 'The implementation of the hidden Markov model is based on that of Rabiner, Levinson and Sondhi (1983).', 'By exploiting the fact that the matrix of probabilities P(Eqvi I Ci) is sparse, a considerable improvement can be gained over the basic training algorithm in which iterations are made over all states.', 'The initial values of the model parameters are calculated from word occurrence probabilities, such that words are initially assumed to function equally probably as any of their possible categories.', 'Superlative and comparative adjectives were collapsed into a single adjective category, to economize on the overall number of categories.', '(If desired, after tagging the finer category can be replaced).', 'In the basic model all punctuation except sentence boundaries was ignored.', 'An interesting observation is worth noting with regard to words that can act both as auxiliary and main verbs.', 'Modal auxiliaries were consistently tagged as auxiliary whereas the tagging for other auxiliaries (e.g. ""is .... have"" etc.) was more variable.', 'This indicates that modal auxiliaries can be recognized as a natural class via their pattern of usage.', 'Extending the Basic Model The basic model was used as a benchmark for successive improvements.', 'The first addition was the correct treatment of all non-words in a text.', 'This includes hyphenation, punctuation, numbers and abbreviations.', 'New categories were added for number, abbreviation, and comma.', 'All other punctuation was collapsed into the single new punctuation category.', 'Refinement of Basic Categories The verb states of the basic model were found to be too coarse.', 'For example, many noun/verb ambiguities in front of past participles were incorrectly tagged as verbs.', 'The replacement of the auxiliary category by the following categories greatly improved this: Category Name Words included in Category Be be Been been Being being Have have Have* has, have, had, having be* is, am, are, was, were do* do, does, did modal Modal auxiliaries Unique Equivalence Classes for Common Words Common words occur often enough to be estimated reliably.', 'In a ranked list of words in the corpus the most frequent 100 words account for approximately 50% of the total tokens in the corpus, and thus data is available to estimate them reliably.', 'The most frequent 100 words of the corpus were assigned individually in the model, thereby enabling them to have different distributions over their categories.', 'This leaves 50% of the corpus for training all the other equivalence classes.', 'Editing the Transition Structure A common error in the basic model was the assignment of the word ""to"" to the to-infcategory (""to"" acting as an infinitive marker) instead of preposition before noun phrases.', 'This is not surprising, because ""to"" is the only member of the to-inf category, P(Wi = ""to"" [ Ci = to-in]) = 1.0.', 'In contrast, P(Wi = ""to"" I Ci = preposition) = 0.086, because many other words share the preposition state.', 'Unless transition probabilities are highly constraining, the higher probability paths will tend to go through the

the previous two word categories.', 'Transition probabilities are then of the form P(Ci [ Ci1, Ci2).', 'For an n category model this requires n 3 transition probabilities.', 'Increasing the order of the conditioning requires exponentially more parameters.', 'In practice, models have been limited to second-order, and smoothing methods are normally required to deal with the problem of estimation

frequently enough to be estimated properly: e.g. P(Ci = determiner [ el1 -~ determiner, Ci2 = determiner).', 'An alternative to uniformly increasing the order of the conditioning is to extend it selectively.', 'Mixed higher- order context can be modeled by introducing explicit state sequences.', 'In the arrangement the basic first-order network remains, permitting all possible category sequences, and modeling first-order dependency.', 'The basic network is then augmented with the extra state sequences which model certain category sequences in more detail.', 'The design of the augmented network has been based on linguistic considerations and also upon an analysis of tagging errors made by the basic network.', 'As an example, we may consider a systematic error made by the basic model.', 'It concerns the disambiguation of the equivalence class adjective-or-noun following a determiner.', 'The error is exemplified by the sentence fragment ""The period of..."", where ""period"" is tagged as an adjective.', 'To model the context necessary to correct the error, two extra states are used, as shown in Figure 1.', 'The ""augmented network"" uniquely models all second-order dependencies of the type determiner -noun - X, and determiner -adjective -X (X ranges over {cl...cn}).', 'Training a hidden Markov model having this topology corrected all nine instances of the error in the test data.', 'An important point to note is that improving the model detail in this manner does not forcibly correct the error.', 'The actual patterns of category usage must be distinct in the language.', '95 To complete the description of the augmented model it is necessary to mention tying of the model states (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980).', 'Whenever a transition is made to a state, the state-dependent probability distribution P(Eqvi I Ci) is used to obtain the probability of the observed equivalence class.', 'A state is generally used in several places (E.g. in Figure 1.', 'there are two noun states, and two adjective states: one of each in the augmented network, and in the basic network).', 'The distributions P(Eqvi I Ci) are considered to be the same for every instance of the same state.', 'Their estimates are pooled and reassigned identically after each iteration of the Baum-Welch algorithm.', 'Modeling Dependencies across Phrases Linguistic considerations can be used to correct errors made by the model.', 'In this section two illustrations are given, concerning simple subject/verb agreement across an intermediate prepositional phrase.', 'These are exemplified by the following sentence fragments: 1.', '""Temperatures in the upper mantle range apparently from...."".', '2.', '""The velocity of the seismic waves rises to..."".', 'The basic model tagged these sentences correctly, except for- ""range"" and ""rises"" which were tagged as noun and plural-noun respectively 1.', 'The basic network cannot model the dependency of the number of the verb on its subject, which precedes it by a prepositional phrase.', 'To model such dependency across the phrase, the networks shown in Figure 2 can be used.', 'It can be seen that only simple forms of prepositional phrase are modeled in the networks; a single noun may be optionally preceded by a single adjective and/or determiner.', 'The final transitions in the networks serve to discriminate between the correct and incorrect category assignment given the selected preceding context.', 'As in the previous section, the corrections are not programmed into the model.', 'Only context has been

the disadvantage that they cannot share training data.', 'This problem could be resolved by tying corresponding transitions together.', 'Alternatively, investigation of a trainable grammar (Baker, 1979; Fujisaki et al., 1989) may be a fruitful way to further develop the model in terms of grammatical components.', 'A model containing all of the refinements described, was tested using a magazine

obvious.', 'In cases where the choice of tag was unclear (as often occurs in idioms), the tag was ruled as incorrect.', 'For example, 9 errors are from 3 instances of ""... as well as ..."" that arise in the text.', 'It would be appropriate to deal with idioms separately, as done by Gaxside, Leech and Sampson (1987).', 'Typical errors beyond the scope of the model described here are exemplified by incorrect adverbial and prepositional assignment.', '1 It is easy to construct counterexamples to the sentences presented here, where the tagging would be correct.', 'However, the training procedure

17,I05-5011,Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs,"['Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task.', 'We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.', 'We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.', 'The first stage identifies a keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets.', 'The second stage links sets which involve the same pairs of individual NEs.', 'A total of 13,976 phrases were grouped.', 'The accuracy of the sets in representing paraphrase ranged from 73% to 99%, depending on the NE categories and set sizes; the accuracy of the links for two evaluated domains was 73% and 86%.', 'One of the difficulties in Natural Language Processing is the fact that there are many ways to express the same thing or event.', 'If the expression is a word or a short phrase (like â\x80\x9ccorporationâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9ccompanyâ\x80\x9d), it is called a â\x80\x9csynonymâ\x80\x9d.', 'There has been a lot of research on such lexical relations, along with the creation of resources such as WordNet.', 'If the expression is longer or complicated (like â\x80\x9cA buys Bâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cAâ\x80\x99s purchase of Bâ\x80\x9d), it is called â\x80\x9cparaphraseâ\x80\x9d, i.e. a set of phrases which express the same thing or event.', 'Recently, this topic has been getting more attention, as is evident from the Paraphrase Workshops in 2003 and 2004, driven by the needs of various NLP applications.', 'For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâ\x80\x99s query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâ\x80\x99s question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.', 'Also, in Information Extraction (IE), in which the system tries to extract elements of some events (e.g. date and company names of a corporate merger event), several event instances from different news articles have to be aligned even if these are expressed differently.', 'We realize the importance of paraphrase; however, the major obstacle is the construction of paraphrase knowledge.', 'For example, we can easily imagine that the number of paraphrases for â\x80\x9cA buys Bâ\x80\x9d is enormous and it is not possible to create a comprehensive inventory by hand.', 'Also, we donâ\x80\x99t know how many such paraphrase sets are necessary to cover even some everyday things or events.', 'Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.', 'So, there is a limitation that IE can only be performed for a predefined task, like â\x80\x9ccorporate mergersâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cmanagement successionâ\x80\x9d.', 'In order to create an IE system for a new domain, one has to spend a long time to create the knowledge.', 'So, it is too costly to make IE technology â\x80\x9copen- domainâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9con-demandâ\x80\x9d like IR or QA.', 'In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.', 'We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.', 'After tagging a large corpus with an automatic NE tagger, the method tries to find sets of paraphrases automatically without being given a seed phrase or any kinds of cue.', '2.1 Overview.', 'Before explaining our method in detail, we present a brief overview in this subsection.', 'First, from a large corpus, we extract all the NE instance pairs.', 'Here, an NE instance pair is any pair of NEs separated by at most 4 syntactic chunks; for example, â\x80\x9cIBM plans to acquire Lotusâ\x80\x9d.', 'For each pair we also record the context, i.e. the phrase between the two NEs (Step1).', 'Next, for each pair of NE categories, we collect all the contexts and find the keywords which are topical for that NE category pair.', 'We use a simple TF/IDF method to measure the topicality of words.', 'Hereafter, each pair of NE categories will be called a domain; e.g. the â\x80\x9cCompany â\x80\x93 Companyâ\x80\x9d domain, which we will call CC- domain (Step 2).', 'For each domain, phrases which contain the same keyword are gathered to build a set of phrases (Step 3).', 'Finally, we find links between sets of phrases, based on the NE instance pair data (for example, different phrases which link â\x80\x9cIBMâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cLotusâ\x80\x9d) (Step 4).', 'As we shall see, most of the linked sets are paraphrases.', 'This overview is illustrated in Figure 1.', 'Corpus Step 1 NE pair instances Step 2 Step 1.', 'Extract NE instance pairs with contexts First, we extract NE pair instances with their context from the corpus.', 'The sentences in the corpus were tagged by a transformation-based chunker and an NE tagger.', 'The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004].', 'These 140 NE categories are designed by extending MUCâ\x80\x99s 7 NE categories with finer sub-categories (such as Company, Institute, and Political Party for Organization; and Country, Province, and City for Location) and adding some new types of NE categories (Position Title, Product, Event, and Natural Object).', 'All the NE pair instances which co-occur separated by at most 4 chunks are collected along with information about their NE types and the phrase between the NEs (the â\x80\x98contextâ\x80\x99).', 'Figure 2 shows examples of extracted NE pair instances and their contexts.', 'The data is sorted based on the frequency of the context (â\x80\x9ca unit ofâ\x80\x9d appeared 314 times in the corpus) and the NE pair instances appearing with that context are shown with their frequency (e.g. â\x80\x9cNBCâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cGeneral Electric Co.â\x80\x9d appeared 10 times with the context â\x80\x9ca unit ofâ\x80\x9d).', 'Step 2.', 'Find keywords for each NE pair When we look at the contexts for each domain, we noticed that there is one or a few important words which indicate the relation between the NEs (for example, the word â\x80\x9cunitâ\x80\x9d for the phrase â\x80\x9ca unit ofâ\x80\x9d).', 'Once we figure out the important word (e.g. keyword), we believe we can capture the meaning of the phrase by the keyword.', 'We used the TF/ITF metric to identify keywords.', 'keywords Step 3 Sets of phrases based on keywords Step 4 Links between sets of phrases All the contexts collected for a given domain are gathered in a bag and the TF/ITF scores are calculated for all the words except stopwords in the bag.', 'Here, the term frequency (TF) is the frequency of a word in the bag and the inverse term frequency (ITF) is the inverse of the log of the frequency in the entire corpus.', 'Figure 3 Figure 1.', 'Overview of the method 2.2 Step by Step Algorithm.', 'In this section, we will explain the algorithm step by step with examples.', 'Because of their size, the examples (Figures 2 to 4) appear at the end of the paper.', 'shows some keywords with their scores.', 'Step 3.', 'Gather phrases using keywords Next, we select a keyword for each phrase â\x80\x93 the top-ranked word based on the TF/IDF metric.', '(If the TF/IDF score of that word is below a threshold, the phrase is discarded.)', 'We then gather all phrases with the same keyword.', 'Figure 4 shows some such phrase sets based on keywords in the CC-domain.', 'Step 4.', 'Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.', 'However, there are phrases which express the same meanings even though they do not share the same keyword.', 'For example, in Figure 3, we can see that the phrases in the â\x80\x9cbuyâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cacquireâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cpurchaseâ\x80\x9d sets are mostly paraphrases.', 'At this step, we will try to link those sets, and put them into a single cluster.', 'Our clue is the NE instance pairs.', 'If the same pair of NE instances is used with different phrases, these phrases are likely to be paraphrases.', 'For example, the two NEs â\x80\x9cEastern Group Plcâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cHanson Plcâ\x80\x9d have the following contexts.', 'Here, â\x80\x9cEGâ\x80\x9d represents â\x80\x9cEastern Group Plcâ\x80\x9d.', 'and â\x80\x9cHâ\x80\x9d represents â\x80\x9cHanson Plcâ\x80\x9d.', 'x EG, has agreed to be bought by H x EG, now owned by H x H to acquire EG x Hâ\x80\x99s agreement to buy EG Three of those phrases are actually paraphrases, but sometime there could be some noise; such as the second phrase above.', 'So, we set a threshold that at least two examples are required to build a link.', 'More examples are shown in Figure 5.', 'Notice that the CC-domain is a special case.', 'As the two NE categories are the same, we canâ\x80\x99t differentiate phrases with different orders of par ticipants â\x80\x93 whether the buying company or the to-be-bought company comes first.', 'The links can solve the problem.', 'As can be seen in the example, the first two phrases have a different order of NE names from the last two, so we can determine that the last two phrases represent a reversed relation.', 'In figure 4, reverse relations are indicated by `*â\x80\x99 next to the frequency.', 'Now we have sets of phrases which share a keyword and we have links between those sets.', '3.1 Corpora.', 'For the experiments, we used four newswire corpora, the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post, The New York Times, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal, all published in 1995.', 'They contain about 200M words (25M, 110M, 40M and 19M words, respectively).', 'All the sentences have been analyzed by our chunker and NE tag- ger.', 'The procedure using the tagged sentences to discover paraphrases takes about one hour on a 2GHz Pentium 4 PC with 1GB of memory.', '3.2 Results.', 'In this subsection, we will report the results of the experiment, in terms of the number of words, phrases or clusters.', 'We will report the evaluation results in the next subsection.', 'Step 1.', 'Extract NE pair instances with contexts From the four years of newspaper corpus, we extracted 1.9 million pairs of NE instances.', 'The most frequent NE category pairs are â\x80\x9cPerson - Person (209,236), followed by â\x80\x9cCountry - Coun- tryâ\x80\x9d (95,123) and â\x80\x9cPerson - Countryâ\x80\x9d (75,509).', 'The frequency of the Company â\x80\x93 Company domain ranks 11th with 35,567 examples.', 'As lower frequency examples include noise, we set a threshold that an NE category pair should appear at least 5 times to be considered and an NE instance pair should appear at least twice to be considered.', 'This limits the number of NE category pairs to 2,000 and the number of NE pair instances to 0.63 million.', 'Step 2.', 'Find keywords for each NE pair The keywords are found for each NE category pair.', 'For example, in the CC-domain, 96 keywords are found which have TF/ITF scores above a threshold; some of them are shown in Figure 3.', 'It is natural that the larger the data in the domain, the more keywords are found.', 'In the â\x80\x9cPerson â\x80\x93 Personâ\x80\x9d domain, 618 keywords are found, and in the â\x80\x9cCountry â\x80\x93 Countryâ\x80\x9d domain, 303 keywords are found.', 'In total, for the 2,000 NE category pairs, 5,184 keywords are found.', 'Step 3.', 'Gather phrases using keywords Now, the keyword with the top TF/ITF score is selected for each phrase.', 'If a phrase does not contain any keywords, the phrase is discarded.', 'For example, out of 905 phrases in the CC- domain, 211 phrases contain keywords found in step 2.', 'In total, across all domains, we kept 13,976 phrases with keywords.', 'Step 4.', 'Link phrases based on instance pairs Using NE instance pairs as a clue, we find links between sets of phrases.', 'In the CC-domain, there are 32 sets of phrases which contain more than 2 phrases.', 'We concentrate on those sets.', 'Among these 32 sets, we found the following pairs of sets which have two or more links.', 'Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances.', 'buy - acquire (5) buy - agree (2) buy - purchase (5) buy - acquisition (7) buy - pay (2)* buy - buyout (3) buy - bid (2) acquire - purchase (2) acquire - acquisition (2) acquire - pay (2)* purchase - acquisition (4) purchase - stake (2)* acquisition - stake (2)* unit - subsidiary (2) unit - parent (5) It is clear that these links form two clusters which are mostly correct.', 'We will describe the evaluation of such clusters in the next subsection.', '3.3 Evaluation Results.', 'We evaluated the results based on two metrics.', 'One is the accuracy within a set of phrases which share the same keyword; the other is the accuracy of links.', 'We picked two domains, the CC-domain and the â\x80\x9cPerson â\x80\x93 Companyâ\x80\x9d domain (PC-domain), for the evaluation, as the entire system output was too large to evaluate.', 'It is not easy to make a clear definition of â\x80\x9cparaphraseâ\x80\x9d.', 'Sometimes extracted phrases by themselves are not meaningful to consider without context, but we set the following criteria.', 'If two phrases can be used to express the same relationship within an information extraction application (â\x80\x9cscenarioâ\x80\x9d), these two phrases are paraphrases.', 'Although this is not a precise criterion, most cases we evaluated were relatively clear-cut.', 'In general, different modalities (â\x80\x9cplanned to buyâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cagreed to buyâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cboughtâ\x80\x9d) were considered to express the same relationship within an extraction setting.', 'We did have a problem classifying some modified noun phrases where the modified phrase does not represent a qualified or restricted form of the head, like â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d, as these are both represented by the keyword â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d.', 'In this specific case, as these two titles could fill the same column of an IE table, we regarded them as paraphrases for the evaluation.', 'Evaluation within a set The evaluation of paraphrases within a set of phrases which share a keyword is illustrated in Figure 4.', 'For each set, the phrases with bracketed frequencies are considered not paraphrases in the set.', ""For example, the phrase â\x80\x9c's New York-based trust unit,â\x80\x9d is not a paraphrase of the other phrases in the â\x80\x9cunitâ\x80\x9d set."", 'As you can see in the figure, the accuracy for the domain is quite high except for the â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d set, which contains various expressions representing different relationships for an IE application.', 'The accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the number of paraphrases to the total number of phrases in the set.', 'The results, along with the total number of phrases, are shown in Table 1.', 'D o m ai n # of ph ras es t o t a l p h r

shows the evaluation result based on the number of phrases in a set.', 'The larger sets are more accurate than the small sets.', 'We can make several observations on the cause of errors.', 'One is that smaller sets sometime have meaningless keywords, like â\x80\x9cstrengthâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9caddâ\x80\x9d in the CC-domain, or â\x80\x9ccompareâ\x80\x9d in the PC-domain.', 'Eight out of the thirteen errors in the high frequency phrases in the CC-domain are the phrases in â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d.', 'As can be seen in Figure 3, the phrases in the â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d set include completely different relationships, which are not paraphrases.', 'Other errors include NE tagging errors and errors due to a phrase which includes other NEs.', 'For example, in the phrase â\x80\x9cCompany-A last week purchased rival Marshalls from Company-Bâ\x80\x9d, the purchased company is Marshalls, not Company-B.', 'Also there are cases where one of the two NEs belong to a phrase outside of the relation.', 'For example, from the sentence â\x80\x9cMr.', 'Smith estimates Lotus will make a profit this quarterâ\x80¦â\x80\x9d, our system extracts â\x80\x9cSmith esti mates Lotusâ\x80\x9d as an instance.', 'Obviously â\x80\x9cLotusâ\x80\x9d is part of the following clause rather than being the object of â\x80\x9cestimatesâ\x80\x9d and the extracted instance makes no sense.', 'We will return to these issues in the discussion section.', 'Evaluation of links A link between two sets is considered correct if the majority of phrases in both sets have the same meaning, i.e. if the link indicates paraphrase.', 'All the links in the â\x80\x9cCC-domain are shown in Step 4 in subsection 3.2.', 'Out of those 15 links, 4 are errors, namely â\x80\x9cbuy - payâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cacquire - payâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cpurchase - stakeâ\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cacquisition - stakeâ\x80\x9d.', 'When a company buys another company, a paying event can occur, but these two phrases do not indicate the same event.', 'The similar explanation applies to the link to the â\x80\x9cstakeâ\x80\x9d set.', 'We checked whether the discovered links are listed in WordNet.', 'Only 2 link in the CC- domain (buy-purchase, acquire-acquisition) and 2 links (trader-dealer and head-chief) in the PC- domain are found in the same synset of Word- Net 2.1 (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/).', 'This result suggests the benefit of using the automatic discovery method.', 'D o m ai n Li n k ac cu ra cy W N c o v e r a g e C C 7 3 . 3 % 2 / 1 1 P C 8 8 . 9 % 2 / 8 Table 2.', 'Evaluation results for links', 'The work reported here is closely related to [Ha- segawa et al. 04].', 'First, we will describe their method and compare it with our method.', 'They first collect the NE instance pairs and contexts, just like our method.', 'However, the next step is clearly different.', 'They cluster NE instance pairs based on the words in the contexts using a bag- of-words method.', 'In order to create good-sized vectors for similarity calculation, they had to set a high frequency threshold, 30.', 'Because of this threshold, very few NE instance pairs could be used and hence the variety of phrases was also limited.', 'Instead, we focused on phrases and set the frequency threshold to 2, and so were able to utilize a lot of phrases while minimizing noise.', '[Hasegawa et al. 04] reported only on relation discovery, but one could easily acquire para phrases from the results.', 'The number of NE instance pairs used in their experiment is less than half of our method.', 'There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.', 'One of such approaches uses comparable documents, which are sets of documents whose content are found/known to be almost the same, such as different newspaper stories about the same event [Shinyama and Sekine 03] or different translations of the same story [Barzilay 01].', 'The availability of comparable corpora is limited, which is a significant limitation on the approach.', 'Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].', 'This approach needs a phrase as an initial seed and thus the possible relationships to be extracted are naturally limited.', 'There has also been work using a bootstrap- ping approach [Brin 98; Agichtein and Gravano 00; Ravichandran and Hovy 02].', 'The basic strategy is, for a given pair of entity types, to start with some examples, like several famous book title and author pairs; and find expressions which contains those names; then using the found expressions, find more author and book title pairs.', 'This can be repeated several times to collect a list of author / book title pairs and expressions.', 'However, those methods need initial seeds, so the relation between entities has to be known in advance.', 'This limitation is the obstacle to making the technology â\x80\x9copen domainâ\x80\x9d.', 'Keywords with more than one word In the evaluation, we explained that â\x80\x9cchairmanâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d are considered paraphrases.', 'However, it is desirable if we can separate them.', 'This problem arises because our keywords consist of only one word.', 'Sometime, multiple words are needed, like â\x80\x9cvice chairmanâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cprime ministerâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cpay forâ\x80\x9d (â\x80\x9cpayâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cpay forâ\x80\x9d are different senses in the CC-domain).', 'One possibility is to use n-grams based on mutual information.', 'If there is a frequent multi-word sequence in a domain, we could use it as a keyword candidate.', 'Keyword detection error Even if a keyword consists of a single word, there are words which are not desirable as keywords for a domain.', 'As was explained in the results section, â\x80\x9cstrengthâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9caddâ\x80\x9d are not desirable keywords in the CC-domain.', 'In our experiment, we set the threshold of the TF/ITF score empirically using a small development corpus; a finer adjustment of the threshold could reduce the number of such keywords.', 'Also, â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d in the CC-domain is not a desirable keyword.', 'It is a relatively frequent word in the domain, but it can be used in different extraction scenarios.', 'In this domain the major scenarios involve the things they agreed on, rather than the mere fact that they agreed.', 'â\x80\x9cAgreeâ\x80\x9d is a subject control verb, which dominates another verb whose subject is the same as that of â\x80\x9cagreeâ\x80\x9d; the latter verb is generally the one of interest for extraction.', 'We have checked if there are similar verbs in other major domains, but this was the only one.', 'Using structural information As was explained in the results section, we extracted examples like â\x80\x9cSmith estimates Lotusâ\x80\x9d, from a sentence like â\x80\x9cMr.', 'Smith estimates Lotus will make profit this quarterâ\x80¦â\x80\x9d.', 'In order to solve this problem, a parse tree is needed to understand that â\x80\x9cLotusâ\x80\x9d is not the object of â\x80\x9cestimatesâ\x80\x9d.', 'Chunking is not enough to find such relationships.', 'This remains as future work.', 'Limitations There are several limitations in the methods.', 'The phrases have to be the expressions of length less than 5 chunks, appear between two NEs.', 'Also, the method of using keywords rules out phrases which donâ\x80\x99t contain popular words in the domain.', 'We are not claiming that this method is almighty.', 'Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.', 'Applications The discovered paraphrases have multiple applications.', 'One obvious application is information extraction.', 'In IE, creating the patterns which express the requested scenario, e.g. â\x80\x9cmanagement

separate research community from speech recognition researchers, despite some obvious overlap of interest.', 'Perhaps one reason for this is that, until relatively recently, few methods have come out of the natural language processing community that were shown to improve upon the very simple language models still standardly in use in speech recognition systems.', 'In the past few years, however, some improvements have been made over these language models through the use of statistical methods of natural language processing, and the development of innovative, linguistically well-motivated techniques for improving language models for speech recognition is generating more interest among computational linguists.', 'While language models built around shallow local dependencies are still the standard in state-of-the-art speech recognition systems, there is reason to hope that better language models can and will be developed by computational linguists for this task.', 'This paper will examine language modeling for speech recognition from a natural language processing point of view.', 'Some of the recent literature investigating approaches that use syntactic structure in an attempt to capture long-distance dependencies for language modeling will be reviewed.', 'A new language model, based on probabilistic top-down parsing, will be outlined and compared with the previous literature, and extensive empirical results will be presented which demonstrate its utility.', 'Two features of our top-down parsing approach will emerge as key to its success.', 'First, the top-down parsing algorithm builds a set of rooted candidate parse trees from left to right over the string, which allows it to calculate a generative probability for each prefix string from the probabilistic grammar, and hence a conditional probability for each word given the previous words and the probabilistic grammar.', 'A left-toright parser whose derivations are not rooted, i.e., with derivations that can consist of disconnected tree fragments, such as an LR or shift-reduce parser, cannot incrementally calculate the probability of each prefix string being generated by the probabilistic grammar, because their derivations include probability mass from unrooted structures.', 'Only at the point when their derivations become rooted (at the end of the string) can generative string probabilities be calculated from the grammar.', 'These parsers can calculate word probabilities based upon the parser state—as in Chelba and Jelinek (1998a)—but such a distribution is not generative from the probabilistic grammar.', 'A parser that is not left to right, but which has rooted derivations, e.g., a headfirst parser, will be able to calculate generative joint probabilities for entire strings; however, it will not be able to calculate probabilities for each word conditioned on previously generated words, unless each derivation generates the words in the string in exactly the same order.', 'For example, suppose that there are two possible verbs that could be the head of a sentence.', ""For a head-first parser, some derivations will have the first verb as the head of the sentence, and the second verb will be generated after the first; hence the second verb's probability will be conditioned on the first verb."", ""Other derivations will have the second verb as the head of the sentence, and the first verb's probability will be conditioned on the second verb."", 'In such a scenario, there is no way to decompose the joint probability calculated from the set of derivations into the product of conditional probabilities using the chain rule.', 'Of course, the joint probability can be used as a language model, but it cannot be interpolated on a word-by-word basis with, say, a trigram model, which we will demonstrate is a useful thing to do.', 'Thus, our top-down parser allows for the incremental calculation of generative conditional word probabilities, a property it shares with other left-to-right parsers with rooted derivations such as Earley parsers (Earley 1970) or left-corner parsers (Rosenkrantz and Lewis 11 1970).', 'A second key feature of our approach is that top-down guidance improves the efficiency of the search as more and more conditioning events are extracted from the derivation for use in the probabilistic model.', 'Because the rooted partial derivation is fully connected, all of the conditioning information that might be extracted from the top-down left context has already been specified, and a conditional probability model built on this information will not impose any additional burden on the search.', 'In contrast, an Earley or left-corner parser will underspecify certain connections between constituents in the left context, and if some of the underspecified information is used in the conditional probability model, it will have to become specified.', 'Of course, this can be done, but at the expense of search efficiency; the more that this is done, the less benefit there is from the underspecification.', 'A top-down parser will, in contrast, derive an efficiency benefit from precisely the information that is underspecified in these other approaches.', 'Thus, our top-down parser makes it very easy to condition the probabilistic grammar on an arbitrary number of values extracted from the rooted, fully specified derivation.', 'This has lead us to a formulation of the conditional probability model in terms of values returned from tree-walking functions that themselves are contextually sensitive.', 'The top-down guidance that is provided makes this approach quite efficient in practice.', 'The following section will provide some background in probabilistic context-free grammars and language modeling for speech recognition.', 'There will also be a brief review of previous work using syntactic information for language modeling, before we introduce our model in Section 4.', 'Three parse trees: (a) a complete parse tree; (b) a complete parse tree with an explicit stop symbol; and (c) a partial parse tree.', ""This section will introduce probabilistic (or stochastic) context-free grammars (PCFGs), as well as such notions as complete and partial parse trees, which will be important in defining our language model later in the paper.'"", 'In addition, we will explain some simple grammar transformations that will be used.', 'Finally, we will explain the notion of c-command, which will be used extensively later as well.', 'PCFGs model the syntactic combinatorics of a language

statistical parsing trials: Sections 2-21 (989,860 words, 39,832 sentences) of the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) served as the training data, Section 24 (34,199 words, 1,346 sentences) as the held-out data for parameter estimation, and Section 23 (59,100 words, 2,416 sentences) as the test data.', 'Section 22 (41,817 words, 1,700 sentences) served as the development corpus, on which the parser was tested until stable versions were ready to run on the test data, to avoid developing the parser to fit the specific test data.', 'Table 2 shows trials with increasing amounts of conditioning information from the left context.', 'There are a couple of things to notice from these results.', 'First, and least surprising, is that the accuracy of the parses improved as we conditioned on more and more information.', 'Like the nonlexicalized parser in Roark and Johnson (1999), we found that the search efficiency, in terms of number of rule expansions considered or number of analyses advanced, also improved as we increased the amount of conditioning.', 'Unlike the Roark and Johnson parser, however, our coverage did not substantially drop as the amount of conditioning information increased, and in some cases, coverage improved slightly.', 'They did not smooth their conditional probability estimates, and blamed sparse data for their decrease in coverage as they increased the conditioning information.', 'These results appear to support this, since our smoothed model showed no such tendency.', 'Figure 5 shows the reduction in parser error, 1 LR---LP , and the reduction in rule expansions considered as the conditioning information increased.', 'The bulk of the improvement comes from simply conditioning on the labels of the parent and the closest sibling to the node being expanded.', 'Interestingly, conditioning all POS expansions on two c-commanding heads made no difference in accuracy compared to conditioning only leftmost POS expansions on a single c-commanding head; but it did improve the efficiency.', ""These results, achieved using very straightforward conditioning events and considering only the left context, are within one to four points of the best published Observed running time on Section 23 of the Penn Treebank, with the full conditional probability model and beam of 10-11, using one 300 MHz UltraSPARC processor and 256MB of RAM of a Sun Enterprise 450. accuracies cited above.'"", 'Of the 2,416 sentences in the section, 728 had the totally correct parse, 30.1 percent tree accuracy.', 'Also, the parser returns a set of candidate parses, from which we have been choosing the top ranked; if we use an oracle to choose the parse with the highest accuracy from among the candidates (which averaged 70.0 in number per sentence), we find an average labeled precision/recall of 94.1, for sentences of length < 100.', 'The parser, thus, could be used as a front end to some other model, with the hopes of selecting a more accurate parse from among the final candidates.', 'While we have shown that the conditioning information improves the efficiency in terms of rule expansions considered and analyses advanced, what does the efficiency of such a parser look like in practice?', 'Figure 6 shows the observed time at our standard base beam of 10-11 with the full conditioning regimen, alongside an approximation of the reported observed (linear) time in Ratnaparkhi (1997).', 'Our observed times look polynomial, which is to be expected given our pruning strategy: the denser the competitors within a narrow probability range of the best analysis, the more time will be spent working on these competitors; and the farther along in the sentence, the more chance for ambiguities that can lead to such a situation.', 'While our observed times are not linear, and are clearly slower than his times (even with a faster machine), they are quite respectably fast.', 'The differences between a k-best and a beam-search parser (not to mention the use of dynamic programming) make a running time difference unsurprising.', 'What is perhaps surprising is that the difference is not greater.', 'Furthermore, this is quite a large beam (see discussion below), so that very large improvements in efficiency can be had at the expense of the number of analyses that are retained.', 'The next set of results will highlight what recommends this approach most: the ease with which one can estimate string probabilities in a single pass from left to right across the string.', ""By definition, a PCFG's estimate of a string's probability is the sum of the probabilities of all trees that produce the string as terminal leaves (see Equation 1)."", ""In the beam search approach outlined above, we can estimate the string's probability in the same manner, by summing the probabilities of the parses that the algorithm finds."", 'Since this is not an exhaustive search, the parses that are returned will be a subset of the total set of trees that would be used in the exact PCFG estimate; hence the estimate thus arrived at will be bounded above by the probability that would be generated from an exhaustive search.', 'The hope is that a large amount of the probability mass will be accounted for by the parses in the beam.', 'The method cannot overestimate the probability of the string.', 'Recall the discussion of the grammar models above, and our definition of the set of partial derivations Dw, with respect to a prefix string wil) (see Equations 2 and 7).', 'By definition, Note that the numerator at word wj is the denominator at word w1+1, so that the product of all of the word probabilities is the numerator at the final word, namely, the string prefix probability.', 'We can make a consistent estimate of the string probability by similarly summing over all of the trees within our beam.', 'Let Ht be the priority queue H, before any processing has begun with word w, in the look-ahead.', ""This is a subset of the possible leftmost partial derivations with respect to the prefix string W. Since RV is produced by expanding only analyses on priority queue H;', the set of complete trees consistent with the partial derivations on priority queue Ht is a subset of the set of complete trees consistent with the partial derivations on priority queue HT'', that is, the total probability mass represented by the priority queues is monotonically decreasing."", 'Thus conditional word probabilities defined in a way consistent with Equation 14 will always be between zero and one.', 'Our conditional word probabilities are calculated as follows: As mentioned above, the model cannot overestimate the probability of a string, because the string probability is simply the sum over the beam, which is a subset of the possible derivations.', 'By utilizing a figure of merit to identify promising analyses, we are simply focusing our attention on those parses that are likely to have a high probability, and thus we are increasing the amount of probability mass that we do capture, of the total possible.', 'It is not part of the probability model itself.', 'Since each word is (almost certainly, because of our pruning strategy) losing some probability mass, the probability model is not &quot;proper &quot;—the sum of the probabilities over the vocabulary is less than one.', 'In order to have a proper probability distribution, we would need to renormalize by dividing by some factor.', ""Note, however, that this renormalization factor is necessarily less than one, and thus would uniformly increase each word's probability under the model, that is, any perplexity results reported below will be higher than the &quot;true&quot; perplexity that would be assigned with a properly normalized distribution."", 'In other words, renormalizing would make our perplexity measure lower still.', 'The hope, however, is that the improved parsing model provided by our conditional probability model will cause the distribution over structures to be more peaked, thus enabling us to capture more of the total probability mass, and making this a fairly snug upper bound on the perplexity.', 'One final note on assigning probabilities to strings: because this parser does garden path on a small percentage of sentences, this must be interpolated with another estimate, to ensure that every word receives a probability estimate.', 'In our trials, we used the unigram, with a very small mixing coefficient: following words since the denominator is zero.', 'Thus, Chelba and Jelinek (1998a, 1998b) also used a parser to help assign word probabilities, via the structured language model outlined in Section 3.2.', 'They trained and tested the SLM on a modified, more &quot;speech-like&quot; version of the Penn Treebank.', 'Their modifications included: (i) removing orthographic cues to structure (e.g., punctuation); (ii) replacing all numbers with the single token N; and (iii) closing the vocabulary at 10,000, replacing all other words with the UNK token.', 'They used Sections 00-20 (929,564 words) as the development set, Sections 21-22 (73,760 words) as the check set (for interpolation coefficient estimation), and tested on Sections 23-24 (82,430 words).', 'We obtained the training and testing corpora from them (which we will denote C&J corpus), and also created intermediate corpora, upon which only the first two modifications were carried out (which we will denote no punct).', 'Differences in performance will give an indication of the impact on parser performance of the different modifications to the corpora.', 'All trials in this section used Sections 00-20 for counts, held out 21-22, and tested on 23-24.', 'Table 3 shows several things.', 'First, it shows relative performance for unmodified, no punct, and C&J corpora with the full set of conditioning information.', 'We can see that removing the punctuation causes (unsurprisingly) a dramatic drop in the accuracy and efficiency of the parser.', 'Interestingly, it also causes coverage to become nearly total, with failure on just two sentences per thousand on average.', 'We see the familiar pattern, in the C&J corpus results, of improving performance as the amount of conditioning information grows.', 'In this case we have perplexity results as well, and Figure 7 shows the reduction in parser error, rule expansions, and perplexity as the amount of conditioning information grows.', 'While all three seem to be similarly improved by the addition of structural context (e.g., parents and siblings), the addition of c-commanding heads has only a moderate effect on the parser accuracy, but a very large effect on the perplexity.', 'The fact that the efficiency was improved more than the accuracy in this case (as was also seen in Figure 5), seems to indicate that this additional information is causing the distribution to become more peaked, so that fewer analyses are making it into the beam.', 'Reduction in average precision/recall error, number of rule expansions, and perplexity as conditioning increases.', 'Table 4 compares the perplexity of our model with Chelba and Jelinek (1998a, 1998b) on the same training and testing corpora.', ""We built an interpolated trigram model to serve as a baseline (as they did), and also interpolated our model's perplexity with the trigram, using the same mixing coefficient as they did in their trials (taking 36 percent of the estimate from the trigram).'"", 'The trigram model was also trained on Sections 00-20 of the C&J corpus.', 'Trigrams and bigrams were binned by the total count of the conditioning words in the training corpus, and maximum likelihood mixing coefficients were calculated for each bin, to mix the trigram with bigram and unigram estimates.', 'Our trigram model performs at almost exactly the same level as theirs does, which is what we would expect.', ""Our parsing model's perplexity improves upon their first result fairly substantially, but is only slightly better than their second result.'"", 'However, when we interpolate with the trigram, we see that the additional improvement is greater than the one they experienced.', 'This is not surprising, since our conditioning information is in many ways orthogonal to that of the trigram, insofar as it includes the probability mass of the derivations; in contrast, their model in some instances is very close to the trigram, by conditioning on two words in the prefix string, which may happen to be the two adjacent words.', 'These results are particularly remarkable, given that we did not build our model as a language model per se, but rather as a parsing model.', 'The perplexity improvement was achieved by simply taking the existing parsing model and applying it, with no extra training beyond that done for parsing.', 'The hope was expressed above that our reported perplexity would be fairly close to the &quot;true&quot; perplexity that we would achieve if the model were properly normalized, i.e., that the amount of probability mass that we lose by pruning is small.', ""One way to test this is the following: at each point in the sentence, calculate the conditional probability of each word in the vocabulary given the previous words, and sum them.'"", 'If there is little loss of probability mass, the sum should be close to one.', 'We did this for the first 10 sentences in the test corpus, a total of 213 words (including the end-of-sentence markers).', 'One of the sentences was a failure, so that 12 of the word probabilities (all of the words after the point of the failure) were not estimated by our model.', 'Of the remaining 201 words, the average sum of the probabilities over the 10,000-word vocabulary was 0.9821, with a minimum of 0.7960 and a maximum of 0.9997.', 'Interestingly, at the word where the failure occurred, the sum of the probabilities was 0.9301.', 'In order to get a sense of whether these perplexity reduction results can translate to improvement in a speech recognition task, we performed a very small preliminary experiment on n-best lists.', ""The DARPA '93 HUB1 test setup consists of 213 utterances read from the Wall Street Journal, a total of 3,446 words."", 'The corpus comes with a baseline trigram model, using a 20,000-word open vocabulary, and trained on approximately 40 million words.', ""We used Ciprian Chelba's A* decoder to find the 50 best hypotheses from each lattice, along with the acoustic and trigram scores.'"", 'Given the idealized circumstances of the production (text read in a lab), the lattices are relatively sparse, and in many cases 50 distinct string hypotheses were not found in a lattice.', 'We reranked an average of 22.9 hypotheses with our language model per utterance.', 'One complicating issue has to do with the tokenization in the Penn Treebank versus that in the HUB1 lattices.', ""In particular, contractions (e.g., he are split in the Penn Treebank (he 's) but not in the HUB1 lattices."", 'Splitting of the contractions is critical for parsing, since the two parts oftentimes (as in the previous example) fall in different constituents.', 'We follow Chelba (2000) in dealing with this problem: for parsing purposes, we use the Penn Treebank tokenization; for interpolation with the provided trigram model, and for evaluation, the lattice tokenization is used.', ""If we are to interpolate our model with the lattice trigram, we must wait until we have our model's estimate for the probability of both parts of the contraction; their product can then be interpolated with the trigram estimate."", 'In fact, interpolation in these trials made no improvement over the better of the uninterpolated models, but simply resulted in performance somewhere between the better and the worse of the two models, so we will not present interpolated trials here.', 'Table 5 reports the word and sentence error rates for five different models: (i) the trigram model that comes with the lattices, trained on approximately 40M words, with a vocabulary of 20,000; (ii) the best-performing model from Chelba (2000), which was interpolated with the lattice trigram at A -= 0.4; (iii) our parsing model, with the same training and vocabulary as the perplexity trials above; (iv) a trigram model with the same training and vocabulary as the parsing model; and (v) no language model at all.', 'This last model shows the performance from the acoustic model alone, without the influence of the language model.', 'The log of the language model score is multiplied by the language model (LM) weight when summing the logs of the language and acoustic scores, as a way of increasing the relative contribution of the language model to the composite score.', 'We followed Chelba (2000) in using an LM weight of 16 for the lattice trigram.', 'For our model and the Treebank trigram model, the LM weight that resulted in the lowest error rates is given.', 'The small size of our training data, as well as the fact that we are rescoring n-best lists, rather than working directly on lattices, makes comparison with the other models not particularly informative.', 'What is more informative is the difference between our model and the trigram trained on the same amount of data.', 'We achieved an 8.5 percent relative improvement in word error rate, and an 8.3 percent relative improvement in sentence error rate over the Treebank trigram.', 'Interestingly, as mentioned above, interpolating two models together gave no improvement over the better of the two, whether our model was interpolated with the lattice or the Treebank trigram.', 'This contrasts with our perplexity results reported above, as well as with the recognition experiments in Chelba (2000), where the best results resulted from interpolated models.', 'The point of this small experiment was to see if our parsing model could provide useful information even in the case that recognition errors occur, as opposed to the (generally) fully grammatical strings upon which the perplexity results were obtained.', 'As one reviewer pointed out, given that our model relies so heavily on context, it may have difficulty recovering from even one recognition error, perhaps more difficulty than a more locally oriented trigram.', 'While the improvements over the trigram model in these trials are modest, they do indicate that our model is robust enough to provide good information even in the face of noisy input.', 'Future work will include more substantial word recognition experiments.', 'The last set of results that we will present addresses the question of how wide the beam must be for adequate results.', ""The base beam factor that we have used to this point is 10', which is quite wide."", 'It was selected with the goal of high parser accuracy; but in this new domain, parser accuracy is a secondary measure of performance.', 'To determine the effect on perplexity, we varied the base beam factor in trials on the Chelba and Jelinek corpora, keeping the level of conditioning information constant, and Table 6 shows the results across a variety of factors.', 'The parser error, parser coverage, and the uninterpolated model perplexity (A = 1) all suffered substantially from a narrower search, but the interpolated perplexity remained quite good even at the extremes.', 'Figure 8 plots the percentage increase in parser error, model perplexity, interpolated perplexity, and efficiency (i.e., decrease in rule expansions per word) as the base beam factor decreased.', 'Note that the model perplexity and parser accuracy are quite similarly affected, but that the interpolated perplexity remained far below the trigram baseline, even with extremely narrow beams.', 'The empirical results presented above are quite encouraging, and the potential of this kind of approach both for parsing and language modeling seems very promising.', 'Increase in average precision/recall error, model perplexity, interpolated perplexity, and efficiency (i.e., decrease in rule expansions per word) as base beam factor decreases.', 'With a simple conditional probability model, and simple statistical search heuristics, we were able to find very accurate parses efficiently, and, as a side effect, were able to assign word probabilities that yield a perplexity improvement over previous results.', 'These perplexity improvements are particularly promising, because the parser is providing information that is, in some sense, orthogonal to the information provided by a trigram model, as evidenced by the robust improvements to the baseline trigram when the two models are interpolated.', 'There are several important future directions that will be taken in this area.', 'First, there is reason to believe that some of the conditioning information is not uniformly useful, and we would benefit from finer distinctions.', 'For example, the probability of a preposition is presumably more dependent on a c-commanding head than the probability of a determiner is.', 'Yet in the current model they are both conditioned on that head, as leftmost constituents of their respective phrases.', 'Second, there are advantages to top-down parsing that have not been examined to date, e.g., empty categories.', 'A top-down parser, in contrast to a standard bottom-up chart parser, has enough information to predict empty categories only

that there is a sinÂ\xad gle correct segmentation for a sentence, against which an automatic algorithm can be compared.', 'We have shown that, at least given independent human judgments, this is not the case, and that therefore such simplistic measures should be mistrusted.', 'This is not to say that a set of standards by which a particular segmentation would count as correct and another incorrect could not be devised; indeed, such standards have been proposed and include the published PRCNSC (1994) and ROCLING (1993), as well as the unpublished Linguistic Data Consortium standards (ca.', 'May 1995).', 'However, until such standards are universally adopted in evaluating Chinese segmenters, claims about performance in terms of simple measures like percent correct should be taken with a grain of salt; see, again, Wu and Fung (1994) for further arguments supporting this conclusion.', 'Second, comparisons of different methods are not meaningful unless one can evalÂ\xad uate them on the same corpus.', 'Unfortunately, there is no standard corpus of Chinese texts, tagged with either single or multiple human judgments, with which one can compare performance of various methods.', 'One hopes that such a corpus will be forthÂ\xad coming.', 'Finally, we wish to reiterate an important point.', 'The major problem for our segÂ\xad menter, as for all segmenters, remains the problem of unknown words (see Fung and Wu [1994]).', 'We have provided methods for handling certain classes of unknown words, and models for other classes could be provided, as we have noted.', 'However, there will remain a large number of words that are not readily adduced to any producÂ\xad tive pattern and that would simply have to be added to the dictionary.', 'This implies, therefore, that a major factor in the performance of a Chinese segmenter is the quality of the base dictionary, and this is probably a more important factor-from the point of view of performance alone-than the particular computational methods used.', 'The method reported in this paper makes use solely of unigram probabilities, and is therefore a zeroeth-order model: the cost of a particular segmentation is estimated as the sum of the costs of the individual words in the segmentation.', 'However, as we have noted, nothing inherent in the approach precludes incorporating higher-order constraints, provided they can be effectively modeled within a finite-state framework.', 'For example, as Gan (1994) has noted, one can construct examples where the segmenÂ\xad tation is locally ambiguous but can be

are ""popular"" or not.', ""While Gan's system incorporates fairly sophisticated models of various linguistic information, it has the drawback that it has only been tested with a very small lexicon (a few hundred words) and on a very small test set (thirty sentences); there is therefore serious concern as to whether the methods that he discusses are scalable."", 'Another question that remains unanswered is to what extent the linguistic information he considers can be handled-or at least approximated-by finite-state language models, and therefore could be directly interfaced with the

into the lexical transducer.', 'Despite these limitations, a purely finite-state approach to Chinese word segmentation enjoys a number of strong advantages.', 'The model we use provides a simple framework in which to incorporate a wide variety of lexical information in a uniform way.', 'The use of weighted transducers in particular has the attractive property that the model, as it stands, can be straightforwardly interfaced to other modules of a larger speech or natural language system: presumably one does not want to segment Chinese text for its own sake but instead with a larger purpose in mind.', 'As described in Sproat (1995), the Chinese segmenter presented here fits directly into the context of a broader finite-state model of text analysis for speech synthesis.', 'Furthermore, by inverting the transducer so that it maps from phonemic transcriptions to hanzi sequences, one can apply the segmenter to other problems, such as speech recognition (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994).', 'Since the transducers are built from human-readable descriptions using a lexical toolkit (Sproat 1995), the system is easily maintained and extended.', 'While size of the resulting transducers may

speci?c to the training data and not generalize well to new examples.', 'Therefore learning is followed by a pruning step where some nodes are eliminated or reorganized to produce a tree that can generalize to new circumstances.', 'Test instances are disambiguated by ?nding a path through the learned decision tree from the root to a leaf node that corresponds with the observed features.', 'An instance of an ambiguous word is dis- ambiguated by passing it through a series of tests, where each test asks if a particular bigram occurs in the available window of context.', 'We also include three benchmark learning algorithms in this study: the majority classi?er, the decision stump, and the Naive Bayesian classi?er.', 'The majority classi?er assigns the most common sense in the training data to every instance in the test data.', 'A decision stump is a one node decision tree(Holte, 1993) that is created by stopping the decision tree learner after the single most informative feature is added to the tree.', 'The Naive Bayesian classi?er (Duda and Hart, 1973) is based on certain blanket assumptions about the interactions among features in a corpus.', 'There is no search of the feature space performed to build a representative model as is the case with decision trees.', 'Instead, all features are included in the classi- ?er and assumed to be relevant to the task at hand.', 'There is a further assumption that each feature is conditionally independent of all other features, given the sense of the ambiguous word.', 'It is most often used with a bag of words feature set, where every word in the training sample is represented by a binary feature that indicates whether or not it occurs in the window of context surrounding the ambiguous word.', 'We use the Weka (Witten and Frank, 2000) implementations of the C4.5 decision tree learner (known as J48), the decision stump, and the Naive Bayesian classi?er.', 'Weka is written in Java and is freely available from

occurrences of a particular word in the test data be disambiguated based on a model learned from the sense{tagged instances in the training data.', 'Some words were used in multiple tasks as di?erent parts of speech.', 'For example, there were two tasks associated with bet, one for its use as a noun and the other as a verb.', 'Thus, there are 36 tasks involving the disambiguation of 29 di?erent words.', 'The words and part of speech associated with each task are shown in Table 1 in column 1.', 'Note that the parts of speech are encoded as n for noun, a for adjective, v for verb, and p for words where the part of speech was not provided.', 'The number of test and training instances for each task are shown in columns 2 and 4.', 'Each instance consists of the sentence in which the ambiguous word occurs as well as one or two surrounding sentences.', 'In general the total context available for each ambiguous word is less than 100 surrounding words.', 'The number of distinct senses in the test data for each task is shown in column 3.', 'The following process is repeated for each task.', 'Capitalization and punctuation are removed from the training and test data.', 'Two feature sets are selected from the training data based on the top 100 ranked bigrams according to the power divergence statistic and the Dice CoeÆcient.', 'The bigram must have occurred 5 or more times to be included as a feature.', 'This step ?lters out a large number of possible bi- grams and allows the decision tree learner to focus on a small number of candidate bigrams that are likely to be helpful in the disambiguation process.', 'The training and test data are converted to feature vectors where each feature represents the occurrence of one of the bigrams that belong in the feature set.', 'This representation of the training data is the actual input to the learning algorithms.', 'Decision tree and decision stump learning is performed twice, once using the feature set determined by the power divergence statistic and again using the feature set identi?ed by the Dice CoeÆcient.', 'The majority classi?er simply determines the most frequent sense in the training data and assigns that to all instances in the test data.', 'The Naive Bayesian classi?er is based on a feature set where every word that occurs 5 or more times in the training data is included as a feature.', 'All of these learned models are used to disambiguate the test data.', 'The test data is kept separate until this stage.', 'We employ a ?ne grained scoring method, where a word is counted as correctly disambiguated only when the assigned sense tag exactly matches the true sense tag.', 'No partial credit is assigned for near misses.', 'The accuracy attained by each of the learning algorithms is shown in Table 1.', 'Column 5 reports the accuracy of the majority classi?er, columns 6 and 7 show the best and average accuracy reported by the 10 participating SENSEVAL teams.', 'The evaluation at SENSEVAL was based on precision and recall, so we converted those scores to accuracy by taking their product.', 'However, the best precision and recall may have come from di?erent teams, so the best accuracy shown in column 6 may actually be higher than that of any single participating SENSEVAL system.', 'The average accuracy in column 7 is the product of the average precision and recall reported

feature set determined by the power divergence statistic.', 'The last line of Table 1 shows the win-tie-loss score of the decision tree/power divergence method relative to every other method.', 'A win shows it was more accurate than the method in the column, a loss means it was less accurate, and a tie means it was equally accurate.', 'The decision tree/power divergence method was more accurate than the best reported SENSEVAL results for 19 of the 36 tasks, and more accurate for 30 of the 36 tasks when compared to the average reported accuracy.', 'The decision stumps also fared well, proving to be more accurate than the best SENSEVAL results for 14 of the 36 tasks.', 'In general the feature sets selected by the power divergence statistic result in more accurate decision trees than those selected by the Dice CoeÆcient.', 'The power divergence tests prove to be more reliable since they account for all possible events surrounding two words w 1 and w 2 ; when they occur as bigram w 1 w 2 , when w 1 or w 2 occurs in a bigram without the other, and when a bigram consists of neither.', 'The Dice CoeÆcient is based strictly on the event where w 1 and w 2 occur together in a bigram.', 'There are 6 tasks where the decision tree / power divergence approach is less accurate than the SENSEVAL average; promise-n, scrap-n, shirt-n, amaze- v, bitter-p, and sanction-p.', 'The most dramatic difference occurred with amaze-v, where the SENSE- VAL average was 92.4% and the decision tree accuracy was 58.6%.', 'However, this was an unusual task where every instance in the test data belonged to a single sense that was a minority sense in the training data.', 'The characteristics of the decision trees and decision stumps learned for each word are shown in Table 2.', 'Column 1 shows the

tree learner.', 'One of our original hypotheses was that accurate decision trees of bigrams will include a relatively small number of features.', 'This was motivated by the success of decision stumps in performing disambiguation based on a single bigram feature.', 'In these experiments, there were no decision trees that used all of the bigram features identi?ed by the ?ltering step, and for many words the decision tree learner went on to eliminate most of the candidate features.', 'This can be seen by comparing the number of internal nodes with the number of candidate features as shown in columns 4 or 7.', '1 It is also noteworthy that the bigrams ultimately selected by the decision tree learner for inclusion in the tree do not always include those bigrams ranked most highly by the power divergence statistic or the Dice CoeÆcient.', 'This is to be expected, since the selection of the bigrams from raw text is only mea1 For most words the 100 top ranked bigrams form the set of candidate features presented to the decision tree learner.', 'If there are ties in the top 100 rankings then there may be more than 100 features, and if the there were fewer than 100 bi- grams that occurred more than 5 times then all such bigrams are included in the feature set.', 'suring the association between two words, while the decision tree seeks bigrams that partition instances of the ambiguous word into into distinct senses.', 'In particular, the decision tree learner makes decisions as to what bigram to include as nodes in the tree using the gain ratio, a measure based on the overall Mutual Information between the bigram and a particular word sense.', 'Finally, note that the smallest decision trees are functionally equivalent to our benchmark methods.', 'A decision tree with 1 leaf node and no internal nodes (1/1) acts as a majority classi?er.', 'A decision tree with 2 leaf nodes and 1 internal node (2/3) has the structure of a decision stump.', 'One of our long-term objectives is to identify a core set of features that will be useful for disambiguating a wide class of words using both supervised and unsupervised methodologies.', 'We have presented an ensemble approach to word sense disambiguation (Pedersen, 2000) where multiple Naive Bayesian classi?ers, each based on co{ occurrence features from varying sized windows of context, is shown to perform well on the widely studied nouns interest and line.', 'While the accuracy of this approach was as good as any previously published results, the learned models were complex and diÆcult to interpret, in e?ect acting as very accurate black boxes.', 'Our experience has been that variations in learning algorithms are far less signi?cant contributors to disambiguation accuracy than are variations in the feature set.', 'In other words, an informative feature set will result in accurate disambiguation when used with a wide range of learning algorithms, but there is no learning algorithm that can perform well given an uninformative or misleading set of features.', 'Therefore, our focus is on developing and discovering feature sets that make distinctions among word senses.', 'Our learning algorithms must not only produce accurate models, but they should also shed new light on the relationships among features and allow us to continue re?ning and understanding our feature sets.', 'We believe that decision trees meet these criteria.', 'A wide range of implementations are available, and they are known to be robust and accurate across a range of domains.', 'Most important, their structure is easy to interpret and may provide insights into the relationships that exist among features and more general rules of disambiguation.', 'Bigrams have been used as features for word sense disambiguation, particularly in the form of collocations where the ambiguous word is one component of the bigram (e.g., (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994), (Ng and Lee, 1996), (Yarowsky, 1995)).', 'While some of the bigrams we identify are collocations that include the word being disambiguated, there is no requirement that this be the case.', 'Decision trees have been used in supervised learning approaches to word sense disambiguation, and have fared well in a number of comparative studies (e.g., (Mooney, 1996), (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997)).', 'In the former they were used with the bag of word feature sets and in the latter they were used with a mixed feature set that included the part-of-speech of neighboring words, three collocations, and the morphology of the ambiguous word.', 'We believe that the approach in this paper is the ?rst time that decision trees based strictly on bigram features have been employed.', 'The decision list is a closely related approach that has also been applied to word sense disambiguation (e.g., (Yarowsky, 1994), (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998), (Yarowsky, 2000)).', 'Rather than building and traversing a tree to perform disambiguation, a list is employed.', 'In the general case a decision list may suffer from less fragmentation during learning than decision trees; as a practical matter this means that the decision list is less likely to be over{trained.', 'However, we believe that fragmentation also re ects on the feature set used for learning.', 'Ours consists of at most approximately 100 binary features.', 'This results in a relatively small feature space that is not as likely to su?er from fragmentation as are larger spaces.', 'There are a number of immediate extensions to this work.', 'The ?rst is to ease the requirement that bi- grams be made up of two consecutive words.', 'Rather, we will search for bigrams where the component words may be separated by other words in the text.', 'The second is to eliminate the ?ltering step by which candidate bigrams are selected by a power divergence statistic.', 'Instead, the decision tree learner would consider all possible bigrams.', 'Despite increasing the danger of fragmentation, this is an interesting issue since the bigrams judged most informative by the decision tree learner are not always ranked highly in the ?ltering step.', 'In particular, we will determine if the ?ltering process ever eliminates bi- grams that could be signi?cant sources of disambiguation information.', 'In the longer term, we hope to adapt this approach to unsupervised learning, where disambiguation is performed without the bene?t of sense tagged text.', 'We are optimistic that this is viable, since bigram features are easy to identify in raw text.', 'This paper shows that the combination of a simple feature set made up of bigrams and a standard decision tree learning algorithm results in accurate word sense disambiguation.', 'The results of this approach are compared with those from the 1998 SENSEVAL word sense disambiguation exercise and show that the bigram based decision tree approach is more accurate than the best SENSEVAL results for 19 of 36 words.', 'The Bigram Statistics Package has been implemented by Satanjeev Banerjee, who is supported by a Grant{in{Aid of Research, Artistry and Scholarship from the OÆce of the Vice President for Research and the Dean of the

21,N04-1038,Unsupervised Learning of Contextual Role Knowledge for Coreference Resolution,"['We present a coreference resolver called BABAR that uses contextual role knowledge to evaluate possible antecedents for an anaphor.', 'BABAR uses information extraction patterns to identify contextual roles and creates four contextual role knowledge sources using unsupervised learning.', 'These knowledge sources determine whether the contexts surrounding an anaphor and antecedent are compatible.', 'BABAR applies a DempsterShafer probabilistic model to make resolutions based on evidence from the contextual role knowledge sources as well as general knowledge sources.', 'Experiments in two domains showed that the contextual role knowledge improved coreference performance, especially on pronouns.', 'The problem of coreference resolution has received considerable attention, including theoretical discourse models (e.g., (Grosz et al., 1995; Grosz and Sidner, 1998)), syntactic algorithms (e.g., (Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Le- ass, 1994)), and supervised machine learning systems (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Soon et al., 2001).', 'Most computational models for coreference resolution rely on properties of the anaphor and candidate antecedent, such as lexical matching, grammatical and syntactic features, semantic agreement, and positional information.', 'The focus of our work is on the use of contextual role knowledge for coreference resolution.', 'A contextual role represents the role that a noun phrase plays in an event or relationship.', 'Our work is motivated by the observation that contextual roles can be critically important in determining the referent of a noun phrase.', 'Consider the following sentences: (a) Jose Maria Martinez, Roberto Lisandy, and Dino Rossy, who were staying at a Tecun Uman hotel, were kidnapped by armed men who took them to an unknown place.', '(b) After they were released...', '(c) After they blindfolded the men...', 'In (b) â\x80\x9ctheyâ\x80\x9d refers to the kidnapping victims, but in (c) â\x80\x9ctheyâ\x80\x9d refers to the armed men.', 'The role that each noun phrase plays in the kidnapping event is key to distinguishing these cases.', 'The correct resolution in sentence (b) comes from knowledge that people who are kidnapped are often subsequently released.', 'The correct resolution in sentence (c) depends on knowledge that kidnappers frequently blindfold their victims.', 'We have developed a coreference resolver called BABAR that uses contextual role knowledge to make coreference decisions.', 'BABAR employs information extraction techniques to represent and learn role relationships.', 'Each pattern represents the role that a noun phrase plays in the surrounding context.', 'BABAR uses unsupervised learning to acquire this knowledge from plain text without the need for annotated training data.', 'Training examples are generated automatically by identifying noun phrases that can be easily resolved with their antecedents using lexical and syntactic heuristics.', 'BABAR then computes statistics over the training examples measuring the frequency with which extraction patterns and noun phrases co-occur in coreference resolutions.', 'In this paper, Section 2 begins by explaining how contextual role knowledge is represented and learned.', 'Section 3 describes the complete coreference resolution model, which uses the contextual role knowledge as well as more traditional coreference features.', 'Our coreference resolver also incorporates an existential noun phrase recognizer and a DempsterShafer probabilistic model to make resolution decisions.', 'Section 4 presents experimen tal results on two corpora: the MUC4 terrorism corpus, and Reuters texts about natural disasters.', 'Our results show that BABAR achieves good performance in both domains, and that the contextual role knowledge improves performance, especially on pronouns.', 'Finally, Section 5 explains how BABAR relates to previous work, and Section 6 summarizes our conclusions.', 'In this section, we describe how contextual role knowledge is represented and learned.', 'Section 2.1 describes how BABAR generates training examples to use in the learning process.', 'We refer to this process as Reliable Case Resolution because it involves finding cases of anaphora that can be easily resolved with their antecedents.', 'Section 2.2 then describes our representation for contextual roles and four types of contextual role knowledge that are learned from the training examples.', '2.1 Reliable Case Resolutions.', 'The first step in the learning process is to generate training examples consisting of anaphor/antecedent resolutions.', 'BABAR uses two methods to identify anaphors that can be easily and reliably resolved with their antecedent: lexical seeding and syntactic seeding.', '2.1.1 Lexical Seeding It is generally not safe to assume that multiple occurrences of a noun phrase refer to the same entity.', 'For example, the company may refer to Company X in one paragraph and Company Y in another.', 'However, lexically similar NPs usually refer to the same entity in two cases: proper names and existential noun phrases.', 'BABAR uses a named entity recognizer to identify proper names that refer to people and companies.', 'Proper names are assumed to be coreferent if they match exactly, or if they closely match based on a few heuristics.', 'For example, a personâ\x80\x99s full name will match with just their last name (e.g., â\x80\x9cGeorge Bushâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cBushâ\x80\x9d), and a company name will match with and without a corporate suffix (e.g., â\x80\x9cIBM Corp.â\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cIBMâ\x80\x9d).', 'Proper names that match are resolved with each other.', 'The second case involves existential noun phrases (Allen, 1995), which are noun phrases that uniquely specify an object or concept and therefore do not need a prior referent in the discourse.', 'In previous work (Bean and Riloff, 1999), we developed an unsupervised learning algorithm that automatically recognizes definite NPs that are existential without syntactic modification because their meaning is universally understood.', 'For example, a story can mention â\x80\x9cthe FBIâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cthe White Houseâ\x80\x9d, or â\x80\x9cthe weatherâ\x80\x9d without any prior referent in the story.', 'Although these existential NPs do not need a prior referent, they may occur multiple times in a document.', 'By definition, each existential NP uniquely specifies an object or concept, so we can infer that all instances of the same existential NP are coreferent (e.g., â\x80\x9cthe FBIâ\x80\x9d always refers to the same entity).', 'Using this heuristic, BABAR identifies existential definite NPs in the training corpus using our previous learning algorithm (Bean and Riloff, 1999) and resolves all occurrences of the same existential NP with each another.1 2.1.2 Syntactic Seeding BABAR also uses syntactic heuristics to identify anaphors and antecedents that can be easily resolved.', 'Table 1 briefly describes the seven syntactic heuristics used by BABAR to resolve noun phrases.', 'Words and punctuation that appear in brackets are considered optional.', 'The anaphor and antecedent appear in boldface.', '1.', 'Reflexive pronouns with only 1 NP in scope..', 'Ex: The regime gives itself the right...', '2.', 'Relative pronouns with only 1 NP in scope..', 'Ex: The brigade, which attacked ...', 'Ex: Mr. Cristiani is the president ...', 'Ex: The government said it ...', 'Ex: He was found in San Jose, where ...', 'Ex: Mr. Cristiani, president of the country ...', 'Ex: Mr. Bush disclosed the policy by reading it...', 'Table 1: Syntactic Seeding Heuristics BABARâ\x80\x99s reliable case resolution heuristics produced a substantial set of anaphor/antecedent resolutions that will be the training data used to learn contextual role knowledge.', 'For terrorism, BABAR generated 5,078 resolutions: 2,386 from lexical seeding and 2,692 from syntactic seeding.', 'For natural disasters, BABAR generated 20,479 resolutions: 11,652 from lexical seeding and 8,827 from syntactic seeding.', '2.2 Contextual Role Knowledge.', 'Our representation of contextual roles is based on information extraction patterns that are converted into simple caseframes.', 'First, we describe how the caseframes are represented and learned.', 'Next, we describe four contextual role knowledge sources that are created from the training examples and the caseframes.', '2.2.1 The Caseframe Representation Information extraction (IE) systems use extraction patterns to identify noun phrases that play a specific role in 1 Our implementation only resolves NPs that occur in the same document, but in retrospect, one could probably resolve instances of the same existential NP in different documents too.', 'an event.', 'For IE, the system must be able to distinguish between semantically similar noun phrases that play different roles in an event.', 'For example, management succession systems must distinguish between a person who is fired and a person who is hired.', 'Terrorism systems must distinguish between people who perpetrate a crime and people who are victims of a crime.', 'We applied the AutoSlog system (Riloff, 1996) to our unannotated training texts to generate a set of extraction patterns for each domain.', 'Each extraction pattern represents a linguistic expression and a syntactic position indicating where a role filler can be found.', 'For example, kidnapping victims should be extracted from the subject of the verb â\x80\x9ckidnappedâ\x80\x9d when it occurs in the passive voice (the shorthand representation of this pattern would be â\x80\x9c<subject> were kidnappedâ\x80\x9d).', 'The types of patterns produced by AutoSlog are outlined in (Riloff, 1996).', 'Ideally weâ\x80\x99d like to know the thematic role of each extracted noun phrase, but AutoSlog does not generate thematic roles.', 'As a (crude) approximation, we normalize the extraction patterns with respect to active and passive voice and label those extractions as agents or patients.', 'For example, the passive voice pattern â\x80\x9c<subject> were kidnappedâ\x80\x9d and the active voice pattern â\x80\x9ckidnapped <direct object>â\x80\x9d are merged into a single normalized pattern â\x80\x9ckidnapped <patient>â\x80\x9d.2 For the sake of sim plicity, we will refer to these normalized extraction patterns as caseframes.3 These caseframes can capture two types of contextual role information: (1) thematic roles corresponding to events (e.g, â\x80\x9c<agent> kidnappedâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9ckidnapped <patient>â\x80\x9d), and (2) predicate-argument relations associated with both verbs and nouns (e.g., â\x80\x9ckidnapped for <np>â\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cvehicle with <np>â\x80\x9d).', 'We generate these caseframes automatically by running AutoSlog over the training corpus exhaustively so that it literally generates a pattern to extract every noun phrase in the corpus.', 'The learned patterns are then normalized and applied to the corpus.', 'This process produces a large set of caseframes coupled with a list of the noun phrases that they extracted.', 'The contextual role knowledge that BABAR uses for coreference resolution is derived from this caseframe data.', '2.2.2 The Caseframe Network The first type of contextual role knowledge that BABAR learns is the Caseframe Network (CFNet), which identifies caseframes that co-occur in anaphor/antecedent resolutions.', 'Our assumption is that caseframes that co-occur in resolutions often have a 2 This normalization is performed syntactically without semantics, so the agent and patient roles are not guaranteed to hold, but they usually do in practice.', '3 These are not full case frames in the traditional sense, but

all the noun phrases, and looked up each head noun in WordNet (Miller, 1990).', 'We tagged each noun with the top-level semantic classes assigned to it in Word- Net.', 'Second, we identified the 100 most frequent nouns in the training corpus and manually labeled them with semantic tags.', 'This step ensures that the most frequent terms for each domain are labeled (in case some of them are not in WordNet) and labeled with the sense most appropriate for the domain.', 'Initially, we planned to compare the semantic classes of an anaphor and a candidate and infer that they might be coreferent if their semantic classes intersected.', 'However, using the top-level semantic classes of WordNet proved to be problematic because the class distinctions are too coarse.', 'For example, both a chair and a truck would be labeled as artifacts, but this does not at all suggest that they are coreferent.', 'So we decided to use semantic class information only to rule out candidates.', 'If two nouns have mutually exclusive semantic classes, then they cannot be coreferent.', 'This solution also obviates the need to perform word sense disambiguation.', 'Each word is simply tagged with the semantic classes corresponding to all of its senses.', 'If these sets do not overlap, then the words cannot be coreferent.', 'The semantic caseframe expectations are used in two ways.', 'One knowledge source, called WordSemCFSem, is analogous to CFLex: it checks whether the anaphor and candidate antecedent are substitutable for one another, but based on their semantic classes instead of the words themselves.', 'Given an anaphor and candidate, BABAR checks (1) whether the semantic classes of the anaphor intersect with the semantic expectations of the caseframe that extracts the candidate, and (2) whether the semantic classes of the candidate intersect with the semantic ex pectations of the caseframe that extracts the anaphor.', 'If one of these checks fails then this knowledge source reports that the candidate is not a viable antecedent for the anaphor.', 'A different knowledge source, called CFSemCFSem, compares the semantic expectations of the caseframe that extracts the anaphor with the semantic expectations of the caseframe that extracts the candidate.', 'If the semantic expectations do not intersect, then we know that the case- frames extract mutually exclusive types of noun phrases.', 'In this case, this knowledge source reports that the candidate is not a viable antecedent for the anaphor.', '2.3 Assigning Evidence Values.', 'Contextual role knowledge provides evidence as to whether a candidate is a plausible antecedent for an anaphor.', 'The two knowledge sources that use semantic expectations, WordSemCFSem and CFSemCFSem, always return values of -1 or 0.', '-1 means that an NP should be ruled out as a possible antecedent, and 0 means that the knowledge source remains neutral (i.e., it has no reason to believe that they cannot be coreferent).', 'The CFLex and CFNet knowledge sources provide positive evidence that a candidate NP and anaphor might be coreferent.', 'They return a value in the range [0,1], where 0 indicates neutrality and 1 indicates the strongest belief that the candidate and anaphor are coreferent.', 'BABAR uses the log-likelihood statistic (Dunning, 1993) to evaluate the strength of a co-occurrence relationship.', 'For each co-occurrence relation (noun/caseframe for CFLex, and caseframe/caseframe for CFNet), BABAR computes its log-likelihood value and looks it up in the Ï\x872 table to obtain a confidence level.', 'The confidence level is then used as the belief value for the knowledge source.', 'For example, if CFLex determines that the log- likelihood statistic for the co-occurrence of a particular noun and caseframe corresponds to the 90% confidence level, then CFLex returns .90 as its belief that the anaphor and candidate are coreferent.', '3 The Coreference Resolution Model.', 'Given a document to process, BABAR uses four modules to perform coreference resolution.', 'First, a non-anaphoric NP classifier identifies definite noun phrases that are existential, using both syntactic rules and our learned existential NP recognizer (Bean and Riloff, 1999), and removes them from the resolution process.', 'Second, BABAR performs reliable case resolution to identify anaphora that can be easily resolved using the lexical and syntactic heuristics described in Section 2.1.', 'Third, all remaining anaphora are evaluated by 11 different knowledge sources: the four contextual role knowledge sources just described and seven general knowledge sources.', 'Finally, a DempsterShafer probabilistic model evaluates the evidence provided by the knowledge sources for all candidate antecedents and makes the final resolution decision.', 'In this section, we describe the seven general knowledge sources and explain how the DempsterShafer model makes resolutions.', '3.1 General Knowledge Sources.', 'Figure 4 shows the seven general knowledge sources (KSs) that represent features commonly used for coreference resolution.', 'The gender, number, and scoping KSs eliminate candidates from consideration.', 'The scoping heuristics are based on the anaphor type: for reflexive pronouns the scope is the current clause, for relative pronouns it is the prior clause following its VP, for personal pronouns it is the anaphorâ\x80\x99s sentence and two preceding sentences, and for definite NPs it is the anaphorâ\x80\x99s sentence and eight preceding sentences.', 'The semantic agreement KS eliminates some candidates, but also provides positive evidence in one case: if the candidate and anaphor both have semantic tags human, company, date, or location that were assigned via NER or the manually labeled dictionary entries.', 'The rationale for treating these semantic labels differently is that they are specific and reliable (as opposed to the WordNet classes, which are more coarse

The model assumes that evidence also arrives as a probability density function (pdf) over sets of hypotheses.6 Integrating new evidence into the existing model is therefore simply a matter of defining a function to merge pdfs, one representing the current belief system and one representing the beliefs of the new evidence.', 'The DempsterShafer rule for combining pdfs is: to {C}, meaning that it is 70% sure the correct hypothesis is C. The intersection of these sets is the null set because these beliefs are contradictory.', 'The belief value that would have been assigned to the intersection of these sets is .60*.70=.42, but this belief has nowhere to go because the null set is not permissible in the model.7 So this probability mass (.42) has to be redistributed.', 'DempsterShafer handles this by re-normalizing all the belief values with respect to only the non-null sets (this is the purpose of the denominator in Equation 1).', 'In our coreference resolver, we define Î¸ to be the set of all candidate antecedents for an anaphor.', 'Each knowledge source then assigns a probability estimate to each candidate, which represents its belief that the candidate is the antecedent for the anaphor.', 'The probabilities are incorporated into the DempsterShafer model using Equation 1.', 'To resolve the anaphor, we survey the final belief values assigned to each candidateâ\x80\x99s singleton set.', 'If a candidate has a belief value â\x89¥ .50, then we select that candidate as the antecedent for the anaphor.', 'If no candidate satisfies this condition (which is often the case), then the anaphor is left unresolved.', 'One of the strengths of the DempsterShafer model is its natural ability to recognize when several credible hypotheses are still in play.', 'In this situation, BABAR takes the conservative approach and declines to make a resolution.', '4 Evaluation Results.', '4.1 Corpora.', 'We evaluated BABAR on two domains: terrorism and natural disasters.', 'We used the MUC4 terrorism corpus (MUC4 Proceedings, 1992) and news articles from the Reuterâ\x80\x99s text collection8 that had a subject code corresponding to natural disasters.', 'For each domain, we created a blind test set by manually annotating 40 doc uments with anaphoric chains, which represent sets of m3 (S) = ) X â\x88©Y =S 1 â\x88\x92 ) m1 (X ) â\x88\x97 m2 (Y ) m1 (X ) â\x88\x97 m2 (Y ) (1) noun phrases that are coreferent (as done for MUC6 (MUC6 Proceedings, 1995)).', 'In the terrorism domain, 1600 texts were used for training and the 40 test docu X â\x88©Y =â\x88\x85 All sets of hypotheses (and their corresponding belief values) in the current model are crossed with the sets of hypotheses (and belief values) provided by the new evidence.', 'Sometimes, however, these beliefs can be contradictory.', 'For example, suppose the current model assigns a belief value of .60 to {A, B}, meaning that it is 60% sure that the correct hypothesis is either A or B.

23,P04-1036,Finding Predominant Word Senses in Untagged Text,"['word sense disambiguation the heuristic of choosing the most common sense is extremely powerful because the distribution of the senses of a word is often skewed.', 'The problem with using the predominant, or first sense heuristic, aside from the fact that it does not take surrounding context into account, is that it assumes some quantity of handtagged data.', 'Whilst there are a few hand-tagged corpora available for some languages, one would expect the frequency distribution of the senses of words, particularly topical words, to depend on the genre and domain of the text under consideration.', 'We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically.', 'The acquired predominant senses give a of 64% on the nouns of the 2 English all-words task.', 'This is a very promising result given that our method does not require any hand-tagged text, such as SemCor.', 'Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method discovers appropriate predominant senses for words from two domainspecific corpora.', 'The first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised WSD systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account.', 'This is shown by the results of the English all-words task in SENSEVAL-2 (Cotton et al., 1998) in figure 1 below, where the first sense is that listed in WordNet for the PoS given by the Penn TreeBank (Palmer et al., 2001).', 'The senses in WordNet are ordered according to the frequency data in the manually tagged resource SemCor (Miller et al., 1993).', 'Senses that have not occurred in SemCor are ordered arbitrarily and after those senses of the word that have occurred.', 'The figure distinguishes systems which make use of hand-tagged data (using HTD) such as SemCor, from those that do not (without HTD).', 'The high performance of the first sense baseline is due to the skewed frequency distribution of word senses.', 'Even systems which show superior performance to this heuristic often make use of the heuristic where evidence from the context is not sufficient (Hoste et al., 2001).', 'Whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as SemCor is clearly useful, there is a strong case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a WSD system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.', 'SemCor comprises a relatively small sample of 250,000 words.', 'There are words where the first sense in WordNet is counter-intuitive, because of the size of the corpus, and because where the frequency data does not indicate a first sense, the ordering is arbitrary.', 'For example the first sense of tiger in WordNet is audacious person whereas one might expect that carnivorous animal is a more common usage.', 'There are only a couple of instances of tiger within SemCor.', 'Another example is embryo, which does not occur at all in SemCor and the first sense is listed as rudimentary plant rather than the anticipated fertilised egg meaning.', 'We believe that an automatic means of finding a predominant sense would be useful for systems that use it as a means of backing-off (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998; Hoste et al., 2001) and for systems that use it in lexical acquisition (McCarthy, 1997; Merlo and Leybold, 2001; Korhonen, 2002) because of the limited size of hand-tagged resources.', 'More importantly, when working within a specific domain one would wish to tune the first sense heuristic to the domain at hand.', 'The first sense of star in SemCor is celestial body, however, if one were disambiguating popular news celebrity would be preferred.', 'Assuming that one had an accurate WSD system then one could obtain frequency counts for senses and rank them with these counts.', 'However, the most accurate WSD systems are those which require manually sense tagged data in the first place, and their accuracy depends on the quantity of training examples (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002) available.', 'We the WordNet hierarchy.', 'We use WordNet as our sense inventory for this work.', 'The paper is structured as follows.', 'We discuss our method in the following section.', 'Sections 3 and 4 concern experiments using predominant senses from the BNC evaluated against

words.', 'We describe some related work in section 6 and conclude in section 7. are therefore investigating a method of automatically ranking WordNet senses from raw text.', 'Many researchers are developing thesauruses from automatically parsed data.', 'In these each target word is entered with an ordered list of “nearest neighbours”.', 'The neighbours are words ordered in terms of the “distributional similarity” that they have with the target.', 'Distributional similarity is a measure indicating the degree that two words, a word and its neighbour, occur in similar contexts.', 'From inspection, one can see that the ordered neighbours of such a thesaurus relate to the different senses of the target word.', 'For example, the neighbours of star in a dependency-based thesaurus provided by Lin 1 has the ordered list of neighbours: superstar, player, teammate, actor early in the list, but one can also see words that are related to another sense of star e.g. galaxy, sun, world and planet further down the list.', 'We expect that the quantity and similarity of the neighbours pertaining to different senses will reflect the dominance of the sense to which they pertain.', 'This is because there will be more relational data for the more prevalent senses compared to the less frequent senses.', 'In this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses.', 'The neighbours for a word in a thesaurus are words themselves, rather than senses.', 'In order to associate the neighbours with senses we make use of another notion of similarity, “semantic similarity”, which exists between senses, rather than words.', 'We experiment with several WordNet Similarity measures (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2003) which aim to capture semantic relatedness within', 'In order to find the predominant sense of a target word we use a thesaurus acquired from automatically parsed text based on the method of Lin (1998).', 'This provides the nearest neighbours to each target word, along with the distributional similarity score between the target word and its neighbour.', 'We then use the WordNet similarity package (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2003) to give us a semantic similarity measure (hereafter referred to as the WordNet similarity measure) to weight the contribution that each neighbour makes to the various senses of the target word.', 'To find the first sense of a word ( ) we take each sense in turn and obtain a score reflecting the prevalence which is used for ranking.', 'Let be the ordered set of the top scoring neighbours of from the thesaurus with associated distributional similarity scores The thesaurus was acquired using the method

adjectives in adjective-noun relations.', 'We could easily extend the set of relations in the future.', 'A noun, , is thus described by a set of co-occurrence triples and associated frequencies, where is a grammatical relation and is a possible cooccurrence with in that relation.', 'For every pair of nouns, where each noun had a total frequency in the triple data of 10 or more, we computed their

superordinate synset of the two senses and .', 'This is transformed from a distance measure in the WN-Similarity package by taking the reciprocal:', 'In order to evaluate our method we use the data in SemCor as a gold-standard.', 'This is not ideal since we expect that the sense frequency distributions within SemCor will differ from those in the BNC, from which we obtain our thesaurus.', 'Nevertheless, since many systems performed well on the English all-words task for SENSEVAL-2 by using the frequency information in SemCor this is a reasonable approach for evaluation.', 'We generated a thesaurus entry for all polysemous nouns which occurred in SemCor with a frequency 2, and in the BNC with a frequency 10 in the grammatical relations listed in section 2.1 above.', 'The jcn measure uses corpus data for the calculation of IC.', 'We experimented with counts obtained from the BNC and the Brown corpus.', 'The variation in counts had negligible affect on the results.', '3 The experimental results reported here are obtained using IC counts from the BNC corpus.', 'All the results shown here are those with the size of thesaurus entries ( ) set to 50.', '4 We calculate the accuracy of finding the predominant sense, when there is indeed one sense with a higher frequency than the others for this word in SemCor ( ).', 'We also calculate the WSD accuracy that would be obtained on SemCor, when using our first sense in all contexts ( ).', 'The results in table 1 show the accuracy of the ranking with respect to SemCor over the entire set of 2595 polysemous nouns in SemCor with the jcn and lesk WordNet similarity measures.', 'The random baseline for choosing the predominant sense over all these words ( ) is 32%.', 'Both WordNet similarity measures beat this baseline.', 'The random baseline for ( ) is 24%.', 'Again, the automatic ranking outperforms this by a large margin.', 'The first sense in SemCor provides an upperbound for this task of 67%.', 'Since both measures gave comparable results we restricted our remaining experiments to jcn because this gave good results for finding the predominant sense, and is much more efficient than lesk, given the precompilation of the IC files.', 'From manual analysis, there are cases where the acquired first sense disagrees with SemCor, yet is intuitively plausible.', 'This is to be expected regardless of any inherent shortcomings of the ranking technique since the senses within SemCor will differ compared to those of the BNC.', 'For example, in WordNet the first listed sense ofpipe is tobacco pipe, and this is ranked joint first according to the Brown files in SemCor with the second sense tube made of metal or plastic used to carry water, oil or gas etc....', 'The automatic ranking from the BNC data lists the latter tube sense first.', 'This seems quite reasonable given the nearest neighbours: tube, cable, wire, tank, hole, cylinder, fitting, tap, cistern, plate....', 'Since SemCor is derived from the Brown corpus, which predates the BNC by up to 30 years 5 and contains a higher proportion of fiction 6, the high ranking for the tobacco pipe sense according to SemCor seems plausible.', 'Another example where the ranking is intuitive, is soil.', 'The first ranked sense according to SemCor is the filth, stain: state of being unclean sense whereas the automatic ranking lists dirt, ground, earth as the first sense, which is the second ranked sense according to SemCor.', 'This seems intuitive given our expected relative usage of these senses in modern British English.', 'Even given the difference in text type between SemCor and the BNC the results are encouraging, especially given that our results are for polysemous nouns.', 'In the English all-words SENSEVAL-2, 25% of the noun data was monosemous.', 'Thus, if we used the sense ranking as a heuristic for an “all nouns” task we would expect to get precision in the region of 60%.', 'We test this below on the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words data.', 'In order to see how well the automatically acquired predominant sense performs on a WSD task from which the WordNet sense ordering has not been taken, we use the SENSEVAL-2 all-words data (Palmer et al., 2001).', '7 This is a hand-tagged test suite of 5,000 words of running text from three articles from the Penn Treebank II.', 'We use an allwords task because the predominant senses will reflect the sense distributions of all nouns within the documents, rather than a lexical sample task, where the target words are manually determined and the results will depend on the skew of the words in the sample.', 'We do not assume that the predominant sense is a method of WSD in itself.', 'To disambiguate senses a system should take context into account.', 'However, it is important to know the performance of this heuristic for any systems that use it.', 'We generated a thesaurus entry for all polysemous nouns in WordNet as described in section 2.1 above.', 'We obtained the predominant sense for each of these words and used these to label the instances in the noun data within the SENSEVAL-2 English allwords task.', 'We give the results for this WSD task in table 2.', 'We compare results using the first sense listed in SemCor, and the first sense according to the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words test data itself.', 'For the latter, we only take a first-sense where there is more than one occurrence of the noun in the test data and one sense has occurred more times than any of the others.', 'We trivially labelled all monosemous items.', 'Our automatically acquired predominant sense performs nearly as well as the first sense provided by SemCor, which is very encouraging given that our method only uses raw text, with no manual labelling.', 'The performance of the predominant sense provided in the SENSEVAL-2 test data provides an upper bound for this task.', 'The items that were not covered by our method were those with insufficient grammatical relations for the tuples employed.', 'Two such words, today and one, each occurred 5 times in the test data.', 'Extending the grammatical relations used for building the thesaurus should improve the coverage.', 'There were a similar number of words that were not covered by a predominant sense in SemCor.', 'For these one would need to obtain more sense-tagged text in order to use this heuristic.', 'Our automatic ranking gave 67% precision on these items.', 'This demonstrates that our method of providing a first sense from raw text will help when sense-tagged data is not available.', 'A major motivation for our work is to try to capture changes in ranking of senses for documents from different domains.', 'In order to test this we applied our method to two specific sections of the Reuters corpus.', 'We demonstrate that choosing texts from a particular domain has a significant influence on the sense ranking.', 'We chose the domains of SPORTS and FINANCE since there is sufficient material for these domains in this publically available corpus.', 'The Reuters corpus (Rose et al., 2002) is a collection of about 810,000 Reuters, English Language News stories.', 'Many of the articles are economy related, but several other topics are included too.', 'We selected documents from the SPORTS domain (topic code: GSPO) and a limited number of documents from the FINANCE domain (topic codes: ECAT and MCAT).', 'The SPORTS corpus consists of 35317 documents (about 9.1 million words).', 'The FINANCE corpus consists of 117734 documents (about 32.5 million words).', 'We acquired thesauruses for these corpora using the procedure described in section 2.1.', 'There is no existing sense-tagged data for these domains that we could use for evaluation.', 'We therefore decided to select a limited number of words and to evaluate these words qualitatively.', 'The words included in this experiment are not a random sample, since we anticipated different predominant senses in the SPORTS and FINANCE domains for these words.', 'Additionally, we evaluated our method quantitatively using the Subject Field Codes (SFC) resource (Magnini and Cavagli`a, 2000) which annotates WordNet synsets with domain labels.', 'The SFC contains an economy label and a sports label.', 'For this domain label experiment we selected all the words in WordNet that have at least one synset labelled economy and at least one synset labelled sports.', 'The resulting set consisted of 38 words.', 'We contrast the distribution of domain labels for these words in the 2 domain specific corpora.', 'The results for 10 of the words from the qualitative experiment are summarized in table 3 with the WordNet sense number for each word supplied alongside synonyms or hypernyms from WordNet for readability.', 'The results are promising.', 'Most words show the change in predominant sense (PS) that we anticipated.', 'It is not always intuitively clear which of the senses to expect as predominant sense for either a particular domain or for the BNC, but the first senses of words like division and goal shift towards the more specific senses (league and score respectively).', 'Moreover, the chosen senses of the word tie proved to be a textbook example of the behaviour we expected.', 'The word share is among the words whose predominant sense remained the same for all three corpora.', 'We anticipated that the stock certificate sense would be chosen for the FINANCE domain, but this did not happen.', 'However, that particular sense ended up higher in the ranking for the FINANCE domain.', 'Figure 2 displays the results of the second experiment with the domain specific corpora.', 'This figure shows the domain labels assigned to the predominant senses for the set of 38 words after ranking the words using the SPORTS and the FINANCE corpora.', 'We see that both domains have a similarly high percentage of factotum (domain independent) labels, but as we would expect, the other peaks correspond to the economy label for the FINANCE corpus, and the sports label for the SPORTS corpus. inant senses for 38 polysemous words ranked using the SPORTS and FINANCE corpus.', 'Most research in WSD concentrates on using contextual features, typically neighbouring words, to help determine the correct sense of a target word.', 'In contrast, our work is aimed at discovering the predominant senses from raw text because the first sense heuristic is such a useful one, and because handtagged data is not always available.', 'A major benefit of our work, rather than reliance on hand-tagged training data such as SemCor, is that this method permits us to produce predominant senses for the domain and text type required.', 'Buitelaar and Sacaleanu (2001) have previously explored ranking and selection of synsets in GermaNet for specific domains using the words in a given synset, and those related by hyponymy, and a term relevance measure taken from information retrieval.', 'Buitelaar and Sacaleanu have evaluated their method on identifying domain specific concepts using human judgements on 100 items.', 'We have evaluated our method using publically available resources, both for balanced and domain specific text.', 'Magnini and Cavagli`a (2000) have identified WordNet word senses with particular domains, and this has proven useful for high precision WSD (Magnini et al., 2001); indeed in section 5 we used these domain labels for evaluation.', 'Identification of these domain labels for word senses was semiautomatic and required a considerable amount of hand-labelling.', 'Our approach is complementary to this.', 'It only requires raw text from the given domain and because of this it can easily be applied to a new domain, or sense inventory, given sufficient text.', 'Lapata and Brew (2004) have recently also highlighted the importance of a good prior in WSD.', 'They used syntactic evidence to find a prior distribution for verb classes, based on (Levin, 1993), and incorporate this in a WSD system.', 'Lapata and Brew obtain their priors for verb classes directly from subcategorisation evidence in a parsed corpus, whereas we use parsed data to find distributionally similar words (nearest neighbours) to the target word which reflect the different senses of the word and have associated distributional similarity scores which can be used for ranking the senses according to prevalence.', 'There has been some related work on using automatic thesauruses for discovering word senses from corpora Pantel and Lin (2002).', 'In this work the lists of neighbours are themselves clustered to bring out the various senses of the word.', 'They evaluate using the lin measure described above in section 2.2 to determine the precision and recall of these discovered classes with respect to WordNet synsets.', 'This method obtains precision of 61% and recall 51%.', 'If WordNet sense distinctions are not ultimately required then discovering the senses directly from the neighbours list is useful because sense distinctions discovered are relevant to the corpus data and new senses can be found.', 'In contrast, we use the neighbours lists and WordNet similarity measures to impose a prevalence ranking on the WordNet senses.', 'We believe automatic ranking techniques such as ours will be useful for systems that rely on WordNet, for example those that use it for lexical acquisition or WSD.', 'It would be useful however to combine our method of finding predominant senses with one which can automatically find new senses within text and relate these to WordNet synsets, as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) do with unknown nouns.', 'We have restricted ourselves to nouns in this work, since this PoS is perhaps most affected by domain.', 'We are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic, and this method, for other PoS on SENSEVAL-3 data (McCarthy et al., 2004), although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora.', 'The lesk measure can be used when ranking adjectives, and adverbs as well as nouns and verbs (which can also be ranked using jcn).', 'Another major advantage that lesk has is that it is applicable to lexical resources which do not have the hierarchical structure that WordNet does, but do have definitions associated with word senses.', 'We have devised a method that uses raw corpus data to automatically find a predominant sense for nouns in WordNet.', 'We use an automatically acquired thesaurus and a WordNet Similarity measure.', 'The automatically acquired predominant senses were evaluated against the hand-tagged resources SemCor and the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task giving us a WSD precision of 64% on an all-nouns task.', 'This is just 5% lower than results using the first sense in the manually labelled SemCor, and we obtain 67% precision on polysemous nouns that are not in SemCor.', 'In many cases the sense ranking provided in SemCor differs to that obtained automatically because we used the BNC to produce our thesaurus.', 'Indeed, the merit of our technique is the very possibility of obtaining predominant senses from the data at hand.', 'We have demonstrated the possibility of finding predominant senses in domain specific corpora on a sample of nouns.', 'In the future, we will perform a large scale evaluation on domain specific corpora.', 'In particular, we will use balanced and domain specific corpora to isolate words having very different neighbours, and therefore rankings, in the different corpora and to detect and target words for which there is a highly skewed sense distribution in these corpora.', 'There is plenty of scope for further work.', 'We want to investigate the effect of frequency and choice of distributional similarity measure (Weeds et al., 2004).', 'Additionally, we need to determine whether senses which do not occur in a wide variety of grammatical contexts fare badly using distributional measures of similarity, and what can be done to combat this problem using relation specific thesauruses.', 'Whilst we have used WordNet as our sense inventory, it would be possible to use this method with another inventory given a measure of semantic relatedness between the neighbours and the senses.', 'The lesk measure for example, can be used with definitions in any standard machine readable dictionary.', 'We would like to thank Siddharth Patwardhan and Ted Pedersen for making the WN Similarity package publically available.', 'This work was funded by EU-2001-34460 project

24,P05-1004,Supersense Tagging of Unknown Nouns using Semantic Similarity,"['The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is a significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.', 'Supersense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organise their manual insertion into WORDNET.', 'Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present a tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.', 'We describe an unsupervised approach, based on vector-space similarity, which does not require annotated examples but significantly outperforms their tagger.', 'We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity.', 'Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001).', 'In particular, WORDNET (Fellbaum, 1998) has significantly influenced research in NLP.', 'Unfortunately, these resource are extremely time- consuming and labour-intensive to manually develop and maintain, requiring considerable linguistic and domain expertise.', 'Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace with language evolution: sense distinctions are continually made and merged, words are coined or become obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacular.', 'Technical domains, such as medicine, require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings, and a significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary.', 'Bur- gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only a very small degree of overlap.', 'Also, lexical- semantic resources suffer from: bias towards concepts and senses from particular topics.', 'Some specialist topics are better covered in WORD- NET than others, e.g. dog has finer-grained distinctions than cat and worm although this does not reflect finer distinctions in reality; limited coverage of infrequent words and senses.', 'Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus.', 'By WORDNET 2.0, coverage has improved but the problem of keeping up with language evolution remains difficult.', 'consistency when classifying similar words into categories.', 'For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers of the earthâ\x80\x99s atmosphere.', 'These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semiautomatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources.', 'Broad semantic classification is currently used by lexicographers to or- ganise the manual insertion of words into WORDNET, and is an experimental precursor to automatically inserting words directly into the WORDNET hierarchy.', 'Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNETâ\x80\x99s hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.', 'This paper describes an unsupervised approach to supersense tagging that does not require annotated sentences.', 'Instead, we use vector-space similarity to retrieve a number of synonyms for each unknown common noun.', 'The supersenses of these synonyms are then combined to determine the supersense.', 'This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6 and 1.7.1.', '26 Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the ACL, pages 26â\x80\x9333, Ann Arbor, June 2005.', 'Qc 2005 Association for Computational Linguistics L

lexicographer files in WORDNET', 'There are 26 broad semantic classes employed by lexicographers in the initial phase of inserting words into the WORDNET hierarchy, called lexicographer files (lex- files).', 'For the noun hierarchy, there are 25 lex-files and a file containing the top level nodes in the hierarchy called Tops.', 'Other syntactic classes are also organised using lex-files: 15 for verbs, 3 for adjectives and 1 for adverbs.', 'Lex-files form a set of coarse-grained sense distinctions within WORDNET.', 'For example, company appears in the following lex-files in WORDNET 2.0: group, which covers company in the social, commercial and troupe fine-grained senses; and state, which covers companionship.', 'The names and descriptions of the noun lex-files are shown in Table 1.', 'Some lex-files map directly to the top level nodes in the hierarchy, called unique beginners, while others are grouped together as hyponyms of a unique beginner (Fellbaum, 1998, page 30).', 'For example, abstraction subsumes the lex-files attribute, quantity, relation, communication and time.', 'Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call the noun lex-file classes supersenses.', 'There are 11 unique beginners in the WORDNET noun hierarchy which could also be used as supersenses.', 'Ciaramita (2002) has produced a mini- WORDNET by manually reducing the WORDNET hierarchy to 106 broad categories.', 'Ciaramita et al.', '(2003) describe how the lex-files can be used as root nodes in a two level hierarchy with the WORDNET synsets appear ing directly underneath.', 'Other alternative sets of supersenses can be created by an arbitrary cut through the WORDNET hierarchy near the top, or by using topics from a thesaurus such as Rogetâ\x80\x99s (Yarowsky, 1992).', 'These topic distinctions are coarser-grained than WORDNET senses, which have been criticised for being too difficult to distinguish even for experts.', 'Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.', 'They suggest that supersense tagging is similar to named entity recognition, which also has a very small set of categories with similar granularity (e.g. location and person) for labelling predominantly unseen terms.', 'Supersense tagging can provide automated or semi- automated assistance to lexicographers adding words to the WORDNET hierarchy.', 'Once this task is solved successfully, it may be possible to insert words directly into the fine-grained distinctions of the hierarchy itself.', 'Clearly, this is the ultimate goal, to be able to insert new terms into lexical resources, extending the structure where necessary.', 'Supersense tagging is also interesting for many applications that use shallow semantics, e.g. information extraction and question answering.', 'A considerable amount of research addresses structurally and statistically manipulating the hierarchy of WORD- NET and the construction of new wordnets using the concept structure from English.', 'For lexical FreeNet, Beefer- man (1998) adds over 350 000 collocation pairs (trigger pairs) extracted from a 160 million word corpus of broadcast news using mutual information.', 'The co-occurrence window was 500 words which was designed to approximate average document length.', 'Caraballo and Charniak (1999) have explored determining noun specificity from raw text.', 'They find that simple frequency counts are the most effective way of determining the parent-child ordering, achieving 83% accuracy over types of vehicle, food and occupation.', 'The other measure they found to be successful was the entropy of the conditional distribution of surrounding words given the noun.', 'Specificity ordering is a necessary step for building a noun hierarchy.', 'However, this approach clearly cannot build a hierarchy alone.', 'For instance, entity is less frequent than many concepts it subsumes.', 'This suggests it will only be possible to add words to an existing abstract structure rather than create categories right up to the unique beginners.', 'Hearst and SchuÂ¨ tze (1993) flatten WORDNET into 726 categories using an algorithm which attempts to minimise the variance in category size.', 'These categories are used to label paragraphs with topics, effectively repeating Yarowskyâ\x80\x99s (1992) experiments using the their categories rather than Rogetâ\x80\x99s thesaurus.', 'SchuÂ¨ tzeâ\x80\x99s (1992) WordSpace system was used to add topical links, such as between ball, racquet and game (the tennis problem).', 'Further, they also use the same vector-space techniques to label previously unseen words using the most common class assigned to the top 20 synonyms for that word.', 'Widdows (2003) uses a similar technique to insert words into the WORDNET hierarchy.', 'He first extracts synonyms for the unknown word using vector-space similarity measures based on Latent Semantic Analysis and then searches for a location in the hierarchy nearest to these synonyms.', 'This same technique as is used in our approach to supersense tagging.', 'Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) implement a super- sense tagger based on the multi-class perceptron classifier (Crammer and Singer, 2001), which uses the standard collocation, spelling and syntactic features common in WSD and named entity recognition systems.', 'Their insight was to use the WORDNET glosses as annotated training data and massively increase the number of training instances using the noun hierarchy.', 'They developed an efficient algorithm for estimating the model over hierarchical training data.', 'Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) propose a very natural evaluation for supersense tagging: inserting the extra common nouns that have been added to a new version of WORDNET.', 'They use the common nouns that have been added to WORDNET 1.7.1 since WORDNET 1.6 and compare this evaluation with a standard cross-validation approach that uses a small percentage of the words from their WORDNET 1.6 training set for evaluation.', 'Their results suggest that the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set is significantly harder because of the large number of abstract category nouns, e.g. communication and cognition, that appear in the 1.7.1 data, which are difficult to classify.', 'Our evaluation will use exactly the same test sets as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).', 'The WORDNET 1.7.1 test set consists of 744 previously unseen nouns, the majority of which (over 90%) have only one sense.', 'The WORD- NET 1.6 test set consists of several cross-validation sets of 755 nouns randomly selected from the BLLIP training set used by Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).', 'They have kindly supplied us with the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set and one cross-validation run of the WORDNET 1.6 test set.', 'Our development experiments are performed on the WORDNET 1.6 test set with one final run on the WORD- NET 1.7.1 test set.', 'Some examples from the test sets are given in Table 2 with their supersenses.', 'We have

out synonyms for which a small amount of contextual information has been extracted, and so might be unreliable.', 'The final issue is how to deal with polysemy.', 'Does every supersense of each extracted synonym get the whole weight of that synonym or is it distributed evenly between the supersenses like Resnik (1995)?', 'Another alternative is to only consider unambiguous synonyms with a

initial weight could then be divided by the number of supersenses to share out the weight (SHARED).', 'The weight could also be divided by the rank (RANK) to penalise supersenses further down the

their supersense(s).', 'This filtering involves checking that the synonymâ\x80\x99s frequency and number of contexts are large enough to ensure it is reliable.', 'We have experimented with a wide range of cutoffs and the best performance on the 1.6 test set was achieved using a minimum cutoff of 5 for the synonymâ\x80\x99s frequency and the number of contexts it appears in.', 'The next

difference.', 'Finally, we need to decide when to use the similarity measure and when to fall-back to the guessing rules.', 'This is determined by looking at the frequency and number of attributes for the unknown word.', 'Not surprisingly, the similarity system works better than the guessing rules if it has any information at all.', 'The results are summarised in Table 6.', 'The accuracy of the

these concrete words tend to have very fewer other senses, well constrained contexts and a relatively high frequency.', 'These factors are conducive for extracting reliable synonyms.', 'These results also support Ciaramita and Johnsonâ\x80\x99s view that abstract concepts like communication, cognition and state are much harder.', 'We would expect the location supersense to perform well since it is quite concrete, but unfortunately our synonym extraction system does not incorporate proper nouns, so many of these words were classified using the hand-built classifier.', 'Also, in the data from Ciaramita and Johnson all of the words are in lower case, so no sensible guessing rules could help.', 'An alternative approach worth exploring is to create context vectors for the supersense categories themselves and compare these against the words.', 'This has the advantage of producing a much smaller number of vectors to compare against.', 'In the current system, we must compare a word against the entire vocabulary (over 500 000 headwords), which is much less efficient than a comparison against only 26 supersense context vectors.', 'The question now becomes how to construct vectors of supersenses.', 'The most obvious solution is to sum the context vectors across the words which have each supersense.', 'However, our early experiments suggest that this produces extremely large vectors which do not match well against the much smaller vectors of each unseen word.', 'Also, the same questions arise in the construction of these vectors.', 'How are words with multiple supersenses handled?', 'Our preliminary experiments suggest that only combining the vectors for unambiguous words produces the best results.', 'One solution would be to take the intersection between vectors across words for each supersense (i.e. to find the common contexts that these words appear in).', 'However, given the sparseness of the data this may not leave very large context vectors.', 'A final solution would be to consider a large set of the canonical attributes (Curran and Moens, 2002a) to represent each supersense.', 'Canonical attributes summarise the key contexts for each headword and are used to improve the efficiency of the similarity comparisons.', 'There are a number of problems our system does not currently handle.', 'Firstly, we do not include proper names in our similarity system which means that location entities can be very difficult to identify correctly (as the results demonstrate).', 'Further, our similarity system does not currently incorporate multi-word terms.', 'We overcome this by using the synonyms of the last word in the multi-word term.', 'However, there are 174 multi-word terms (23%) in the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set which we could probably tag more accurately with synonyms for the whole multi-word term.', 'Finally, we plan to implement a supervised machine learner to replace the fall- back method, which currently has an accuracy of 37% on the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set.', 'We intend to extend our experiments beyond the Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) set to include previous and more recent versions of WORDNET to compare their difficulty, and also perform experiments over a range of corpus sizes to determine the impact of corpus size on the quality of results.', 'We would like to move onto the more difficult task of insertion into the hierarchy itself and compare against the initial work by Widdows (2003) using latent semantic analysis.', 'Here the issue of how to combine vectors is even more interesting since there is the additional structure of the WORDNET inheritance hierarchy and the small synonym sets that can be used for more fine-grained combination of vectors.', 'Our application of semantic similarity to supersense tagging

frequent in DDT than in PDT, they seem to be more deeply nested, since only about 80% can be projectivized with a single lift, while almost 95% of the non-projective arcs in PDT only require a single lift.', 'In the second part of the experiment, we applied the inverse transformation based on breadth-first search under the three different encoding schemes.', 'The results are given in Table 4.',

Exact Match (EM), i.e. the proportion of sentences for which the dependency graph exactly matches the gold standard.', 'In the labeled version of these metrics (L) both heads and arc labels must be correct, while the unlabeled version (U) only considers heads.', 'The first thing to note is that projectivizing helps in itself, even if no encoding is used, as seen from the fact that the projective baseline outperforms the non-projective training condition by more than half a percentage point on attachment score, although the gain is much smaller with respect to exact match.', 'The second main result is that the pseudo-projective approach to parsing (using special arc labels to guide an inverse transformation) gives a further improvement of about one percentage point on attachment score.', 'With respect to exact match, the improvement is even more noticeable, which shows quite clearly that even if non-projective dependencies are rare on the token level, they are nevertheless important for getting the global syntactic structure correct.', 'All improvements over the baseline are statistically significant beyond the 0.01 level (McNemar’s test).', 'By contrast, when we turn to a comparison of the three encoding schemes it is hard to find any significant differences, and the overall impression is that it makes little or no difference which encoding scheme is used, as long as there is some indication of which words are assigned their linear head instead of their syntactic head by the projective parser.', 'This may seem surprising, given the experiments reported in section 4, but the explanation is probably that the non-projective dependencies that can be recovered at all are of the simple kind that only requires a single lift, where the encoding of path information is often redundant.', 'It is likely that the more complex cases, where path information could make a difference, are beyond the reach of the parser in most cases.', 'However, if we consider precision, recall and Fmeasure on non-projective dependencies only, as shown in Table 6, some differences begin to emerge.', 'The most informative scheme, Head+Path, gives the highest scores, although with respect to Head the difference is not statistically significant, while the least informative scheme, Path – with almost the same performance on treebank transformation – is significantly lower (p <

In contrast, if we assume that f is a linear function of the tensor product of u and v, then we obtain multiplicative models: where C is a tensor of rank 3, which projects the tensor product of u and v onto the space of p. Further constraints can be introduced to reduce the free parameters in these models.', 'So, if we assume that only the ith components of u and v contribute to the ith component of p, that these components are not dependent on i, and that the function is symmetric with regard to the interchange of u and v, we obtain a simpler instantiation of an additive model: Analogously, under the same assumptions, we obtain the following simpler multiplicative model: only the ith components of u and v contribute to the ith component of p. Another class of models can be derived by relaxing this constraint.', 'To give a concrete example, circular convolution is an instance of the general multiplicative model which breaks this constraint by allowing uj to contribute to pi: For example, according to (5), the addition of the two vectors representing horse and run in Figure 1 would yield horse + run = [1 14 6 14 4].', 'Whereas their product, as given by (6), is horse · run = [0 48 8 40 0].', 'Although the composition model in (5) is commonly used in the literature, from a linguistic perspective, the model in (6) is more appealing.', 'Simply adding the vectors u and v lumps their contents together rather than allowing the content of one vector to pick out the relevant content of the other.', 'Instead, it could be argued that the contribution of the ith component of u should be scaled according to its relevance to v, and vice versa.', 'In effect, this is what model (6) achieves.', 'As a result of the assumption of symmetry, both these models are ‘bag of words’ models and word order insensitive.', 'Relaxing the assumption of symmetry in the case of the simple additive model produces a model which weighs the contribution of the two components differently: This allows additive models to become more syntax aware, since semantically important constituents can participate more actively in the composition.', 'As an example if we set α to 0.4 and β to 0.6, then horse= [0 2.4 0.8 4 1.6] and run = [0.6 4.8 2.4 2.4 0], and their sum horse + run = [0.6 5.6 3.2 6.4 1.6].', 'An extreme form of this differential in the contribution of constituents is where one of the vectors, say u, contributes nothing at all to the combination: Admittedly the model in (8) is impoverished and rather simplistic, however it can serve as a simple baseline against which to compare more sophisticated models.', 'The models considered so far assume that components do not ‘interfere’ with each other, i.e., that It is also possible to re-introduce the dependence on K into the model of vector composition.', 'For additive models, a natural way to achieve this is to include further vectors into the summation.', 'These vectors are not arbitrary and ideally they must exhibit some relation to the words of the construction under consideration.', 'When modeling predicate-argument structures, Kintsch (2001) proposes including one or more distributional neighbors, n, of the predicate: Note that considerable latitude is allowed in selecting the appropriate neighbors.', 'Kintsch (2001) considers only the m most similar neighbors to the predicate, from which he subsequently selects k, those most similar to its argument.', 'So, if in the composition of horse with run, the chosen neighbor is ride, ride = [2 15 7 9 1], then this produces the representation horse + run + ride = [3 29 13 23 5].', 'In contrast to the simple additive model, this extended model is sensitive to syntactic structure, since n is chosen from among the neighbors of the predicate, distinguishing it from the argument.', 'Although we have presented multiplicative and additive models separately, there is nothing inherent in our formulation that disallows their combination.', 'The proposal is not merely notational.', 'One potential drawback of multiplicative models is the effect of components with value zero.', 'Since the product of zero with any number is itself zero, the presence of zeroes in either of the vectors leads to information being essentially thrown away.', 'Combining the multiplicative model with an additive model, which does not suffer from this problem, could mitigate this problem: pi = αui +βvi +γuivi (11) where α, β, and γ are weighting constants.', 'We evaluated the models presented in Section 3 on a sentence similarity task initially proposed by Kintsch (2001).', 'In his study, Kintsch builds a model of how a verb’s meaning is modified in the context of its subject.', 'He argues that the subjects of ran in The color ran and The horse ran select different senses of ran.', 'This change in the verb’s sense is equated to a shift in its position in semantic space.', 'To quantify this shift, Kintsch proposes measuring similarity relative to other verbs acting as landmarks, for example gallop and dissolve.', 'The idea here is that an appropriate composition model when applied to horse and ran will yield a vector closer to the landmark gallop than dissolve.', 'Conversely, when color is combined with ran, the resulting vector will be closer to dissolve than gallop.', 'Focusing on a single compositional structure, namely intransitive verbs and their subjects, is a good point of departure for studying vector combination.', 'Any adequate model of composition must be able to represent argument-verb meaning.', 'Moreover by using a minimal structure we factor out inessential degrees of freedom and are able to assess the merits of different models on an equal footing.', 'Unfortunately, Kintsch (2001) demonstrates how his own composition algorithm works intuitively on a few hand selected examples but does not provide a comprehensive test set.', 'In order to establish an independent measure of sentence similarity, we assembled a set of experimental materials and elicited similarity ratings from human subjects.', 'In the following we describe our data collection procedure and give details on how our composition models were constructed and evaluated.', 'Materials and Design Our materials consisted of sentences with an an intransitive verb and its subject.',

galloped) and one incompatible (e.g., horse dissolved).', 'Landmarks were taken from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).', 'Specifically, they belonged to different synsets and were maximally dissimilar as measured by the Jiang and Conrath (1997) measure.3 Our initial set of candidate materials consisted of 20 verbs, each paired with 10 nouns, and 2 landmarks (400 pairs of sentences in total).', 'These were further pretested to allow the selection of a subset of items showing clear variations in sense as we wanted to have a balanced set of similar and dissimilar sentences.', 'In the pretest, subjects saw a reference sentence containing a subject-verb tuple and its landmarks and were asked to choose which landmark was most similar to the reference or neither.', 'Our items were converted into simple sentences (all in past tense) by adding articles where appropriate.', 'The stimuli were administered to four separate groups; each group saw one set of 100 sentences.', 'The pretest was completed by 53 participants.', 'For each reference verb, the subjects’ responses were entered into a contingency table, whose rows corresponded to nouns and columns to each possible answer (i.e., one of the two landmarks).', 'Each cell recorded the number of times our subjects selected the landmark as compatible with the noun or not.', 'We used Fisher’s exact test to determine which verbs and nouns showed the greatest variation in landmark preference and items with p-values greater than 0.001 were discarded.', 'This yielded a reduced set of experimental items (120 in total) consisting of 15 reference verbs, each with 4 nouns, and 2 landmarks.', 'Procedure and Subjects Participants first saw a set of instructions that explained the sentence similarity task and provided several examples.', 'Then the experimental items were presented; each contained two sentences, one with the reference verb and one with its landmark.', 'Examples of our items are given in Table 1.', 'Here, burn is a high similarity landmark (High) for the reference The fire glowed, whereas beam is a low similarity landmark (Low).', 'The opposite is the case for the reference The face glowed.', 'Sentence pairs were presented serially in random order.', 'Participants were asked to rate how similar the two sentences were on a scale of one to seven.', 'The study was conducted remotely over the Internet using Webexp4, a software package designed for conducting psycholinguistic studies over the web.', '49 unpaid volunteers completed the experiment, all native speakers of English.', 'Analysis of Similarity Ratings The reliability of the collected judgments is important for our evaluation experiments; we therefore performed several tests to validate the quality of the ratings.', 'First, we examined whether participants gave high ratings to high similarity sentence pairs and low ratings to low similarity ones.', 'Figure 2 presents a box-and-whisker plot of the distribution of the ratings.', 'As we can see sentences with high similarity landmarks are perceived as more similar to the reference sentence.', 'A Wilcoxon rank sum test confirmed that the difference is statistically significant (p < 0.01).', 'We also measured how well humans agree in their ratings.', 'We employed leave-one-out resampling (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991), by correlating the data obtained from each participant with the ratings obtained from all other participants.', 'We used Spearman’s ρ, a non parametric correlation coefficient, to avoid making any assumptions about the distribution of the similarity ratings.', 'The average inter-subject agreement5 was ρ = 0.40.', 'We believe that this level of agreement is satisfactory given that naive subjects are asked to provide judgments on

our experiments was built on a lemmatised version of the BNC.', 'Following previous work (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007), we optimized its parameters on a word-based semantic similarity task.', 'The task involves examining the degree of linear relationship between the human judgments for two individual words and vector-based similarity values.', 'We experimented with a variety of dimensions (ranging from 50 to 500,000), vector component definitions (e.g., pointwise mutual information or log likelihood ratio) and similarity measures (e.g., cosine or confusion probability).', 'We used WordSim353, a benchmark dataset (Finkelstein et al., 2002), consisting of relatedness judgments (on a scale of 0 to 10) for 353 word pairs.', 'We obtained best results with a model using a context window of five words on either side of the target word, the cosine measure, and 2,000 vector components.', 'The latter were the most common context words (excluding a stop list of function words).', 'These components were set to the ratio of the probability of the context word given the target word to the probability of the context word overall.', 'This configuration gave high correlations with the WordSim353 similarity judgments using the cosine measure.', 'In addition, Bullinaria and Levy (2007) found that these parameters perform well on a number of other tasks such as the synonymy task from the Test ofEnglish as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).', 'Our composition models have no additional parameters beyond the semantic space just described, with three exceptions.', 'First, the additive model in (7) weighs differentially the contribution of the two constituents.', 'In our case, these are the subject noun and the intransitive verb.', 'To this end, we optimized the weights on a small held-out set.', 'Specifically, we considered eleven models, varying in their weightings, in steps of 10%, from 100% noun through 50% of both verb and noun to 100% verb.', 'For the best performing model the weight for the verb was 80% and for the noun 20%.', 'Secondly, we optimized the weightings in the combined model (11) with a similar grid search over its three parameters.', 'This yielded a weighted sum consisting of 95% verb, 0% noun and 5% of their multiplicative combination.', 'Finally, Kintsch’s (2001) additive model has two extra parameters.', 'The m neighbors most similar to the predicate, and the k of m neighbors closest to its argument.', 'In our experiments we selected parameters that Kintsch reports as optimal.', 'Specifically, m was set to 20 and m to 1.', 'Evaluation Methodology We evaluated the proposed composition models in two ways.', 'First, we used the models to estimate the cosine similarity between the reference sentence and its landmarks.', 'We expect better models to yield a pattern of similarity scores like those observed in the human ratings (see Figure 2).', 'A more scrupulous evaluation requires directly correlating all the individual participants’ similarity judgments with those of the models.6 We used Spearman’s p for our correlation analyses.', 'Again, better models should correlate better with the experimental data.', 'We assume that the inter-subject agreement can serve as an upper bound for comparing the fit of our models against the human judgments.', 'Our experiments assessed the performance of seven composition models.', 'These included three additive models, i.e., simple addition (equation (5), Add), weighted addition (equation (7), WeightAdd), and Kintsch’s (2001) model (equation (10), Kintsch), a multiplicative model (equation (6), Multiply), and also a model which combines multiplication with addition (equation (11), Combined).', 'As a baseline we simply estimated the similarity between the reference verb and its landmarks without taking the subject noun into account (equation (8), NonComp).', 'Table 2 shows the average model ratings for High and Low similarity items.', 'For comparison, we also show the human ratings for these items (UpperBound).', 'Here, we are interested in relative differences, since the two types of ratings correspond to different scales.', 'Model similarities have been estimated using cosine which ranges from 0 to 1, whereas our subjects rated the sentences on a scale from 1 to 7.', 'The simple additive model fails to distinguish between High and Low Similarity items.', 'We observe a similar pattern for the non compositional baseline model, the weighted additive model and Kintsch (2001).', 'The multiplicative and combined models yield means closer to the human ratings.', 'The difference between High and Low similarity values estimated by these models are statistically significant (p < 0.01 using the Wilcoxon rank sum test).', 'Figure 3 shows the distribution of estimated similarities under the multiplicative model.', 'The results of our correlation analysis are also given in Table 2.', 'As can be seen, all models are significantly correlated with the human ratings.', 'In order to establish which ones fit our data better, we examined whether the correlation coefficients achieved differ significantly using a t-test (Cohen and Cohen, 1983).', 'The lowest correlation (p = 0.04) is observed for the simple additive model which is not significantly different from the non-compositional baseline model.', 'The weighted additive model (p = 0.09) is not significantly different from the baseline either or Kintsch (2001) (p = 0.09).', 'Given that the basis of Kintsch’s model is the summation of the verb, a neighbor close to the verb and the noun, it is not surprising that it produces results similar to a summation which weights the verb more heavily than the noun.', 'The multiplicative model yields a better fit with the experimental data, ρ = 0.17.', 'The combined model is best overall with ρ = 0.19.', 'However, the difference between the two models is not statistically significant.', 'Also note that in contrast to the combined model, the multiplicative model does not have any free parameters and hence does not require optimization for this particular task.', 'In this paper we presented a general framework for vector-based semantic composition.', 'We formulated composition as a function of two vectors and introduced several models based on addition and multiplication.', 'Despite the popularity of additive models, our experimental results showed the superiority of models utilizing multiplicative combinations, at least for the sentence similarity task attempted here.', 'We conjecture that the additive

only, with no PoS assigned to them.', 'In turn we use two sorts of heuristics, orthogonal to one another, to prune segmentation possibilities based on lexical and grammatical constraints.', 'We simulate lexical constraints by using an external lexical resource against which we verify whether OOV segments are in fact valid Hebrew lexemes.', 'This heuristics is used to prune all segmentation possibilities involving “lexically improper” segments.', 'For the remaining arcs, if the segment is in fact a known lexeme it is tagged as usual, but for the OOV arcs which are valid Hebrew entries

now on all lattice arcs are tagged segments and the assignment of probability P(p —* (s, p)) to lattice arcs proceeds as usual.4 A rather pathological case is when our lexical heuristics prune away all segmentation possibilities and we remain with an empty lattice.', 'In such cases we use the non-pruned lattice including all (possibly ungrammatical) segmentation, and let the statistics (including OOV) decide.', 'We empirically control for the effect of our heuristics to make sure our pruning does not undermine the objectives of our joint task.', 'Previous work on morphological and

serve two goals.', 'Our primary goal is to exploit the resources that are most appropriate for the task at hand, and our secondary goal is to allow for comparison of our models’ performance against

enriching our grammar improves the syntactic performance as well as morphological disambiguation (segmentation and POS tagging) accuracy.', 'This supports our main thesis that decisions taken by single, improved, grammar are beneficial for both tasks.', 'When using the segmentation pruning (using HSPELL) for unseen tokens, performance improves for all tasks as well.', 'Yet we note that the better grammars without pruning outperform the poorer grammars using this technique, indicating that the syntactic context aids, to some extent, the disambiguation of unknown tokens.', 'Table 2

overall higher on their setup, on all measures, indicating that theirs may be an easier dataset.', 'Secondly, for all our models we provide better fine- and coarse-grained POS-tagging accuracy, and

tunes the joint model for optimized syntactic disambiguation at least in as much as their hyper parameters do.', 'An interesting observation is that while vertical markovization benefits all our models, its effect is less evident in Cohen and Smith.', 'On the surface, our model may seem as a special case of Cohen and Smith in which α = 0.', 'However, there is a crucial difference: the morphological probabilities in their model come from discriminative models based on linear context.', 'Many morphological decisions are based on long distance dependencies, and when the global syntactic evidence disagrees with evidence based on local linear context, the two models compete with one another, despite the fact that the PCFG takes also local context into account.', 'In addition, as the CRF and PCFG look at similar sorts of information from within two inherently different models, they are far from independent and optimizing their product is meaningless.', 'Cohen and Smith approach this by introducing the α hyperparameter, which performs best when optimized independently for each sentence (cf.', 'Oracle results).', 'In contrast, our morphological probabilities are based on a unigram, lexeme-based model, and all other (local and non-local) contextual considerations are delegated to the PCFG.', 'This fully generative model caters for real interaction between the

29,P08-1102,A Cascaded Linear Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging,"['We propose a cascaded linear model for joint Chinese word segmentation and partof-speech tagging.', 'With a character-based perceptron as the core, combined with realvalued features such as language models, the cascaded model is able to efficiently utilize knowledge sources that are inconvenient to incorporate into the perceptron directly.', 'Experiments show that the cascaded model achieves improved accuracies on both segmentation only and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging.', 'On the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0, we obtain an error reduction of segmentation and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging over the perceptron-only baseline.', 'Word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging are important tasks in computer processing of Chinese and other Asian languages.', 'Several models were introduced for these problems, for example, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Rabiner, 1989), Maximum Entropy Model (ME) (Ratnaparkhi and Adwait, 1996), and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001).', 'CRFs have the advantage of flexibility in representing features compared to generative ones such as HMM, and usually behaves the best in the two tasks.', 'Another widely used discriminative method is the perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002), which achieves comparable performance to CRFs with much faster training, so we base this work on the perceptron.', 'To segment and tag a character sequence, there are two strategies to choose: performing POS tagging following segmentation; or joint segmentation and POS tagging (Joint S&T).', 'Since the typical approach of discriminative models treats segmentation as a labelling problem by assigning each character a boundary tag (Xue and Shen, 2003), Joint S&T can be conducted in a labelling fashion by expanding boundary tags to include POS information (Ng and Low, 2004).', 'Compared to performing segmentation and POS tagging one at a time, Joint S&T can achieve higher accuracy not only on segmentation but also on POS tagging (Ng and Low, 2004).', 'Besides the usual character-based features, additional features dependent on POS’s or words can also be employed to improve the performance.', 'However, as such features are generated dynamically during the decoding procedure, two limitation arise: on the one hand, the amount of parameters increases rapidly, which is apt to overfit on training corpus; on the other hand, exact inference by dynamic programming is intractable because the current predication relies on the results of prior predications.', 'As a result, many theoretically useful features such as higherorder word or POS n-grams are difficult to be incorporated in the model efficiently.', 'To cope with this problem, we propose a cascaded linear model inspired by the log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2004) widely used in statistical machine translation to incorporate different kinds of knowledge sources.', 'Shown in Figure 1, the cascaded model has a two-layer architecture, with a characterbased perceptron as the core combined with other real-valued features such as language models.', 'We will describe it in detail in Section 4.', 'In this architecture, knowledge sources that are intractable to incorporate into the perceptron, can be easily incorporated into the outside linear model.', 'In addition, as these knowledge sources are regarded as separate features, we can train their corresponding models independently with each other.', 'This is an interesting approach when the training corpus is large as it reduces the time and space consumption.', 'Experiments show that our cascaded model can utilize different knowledge sources effectively and obtain accuracy improvements on both segmentation and Joint S&T.', '2 Segmentation and POS Tagging Given a Chinese character sequence: while the segmentation and POS tagging result can be depicted as: Here, Ci (i = L.n) denotes Chinese character, ti (i = L.m) denotes POS tag, and Cl:r (l < r) denotes character sequence ranges from Cl to Cr.', 'We can see that segmentation and POS tagging task is to divide a character sequence into several subsequences and label each of them a POS tag.', 'It is a better idea to perform segmentation and POS tagging jointly in a uniform framework.', 'According to Ng and Low (2004), the segmentation task can be transformed to a tagging problem by assigning each character a boundary tag of the following four types: We can extract segmentation result by splitting the labelled result into subsequences of pattern s or bm*e which denote single-character word and multicharacter word respectively.', 'In order to perform POS tagging at the same time, we expand boundary tags to include POS information by attaching a POS to the tail of a boundary tag as a postfix following Ng and Low (2004).', 'As each tag is now composed of a boundary part and a POS part, the joint S&T problem is transformed to a uniform boundary-POS labelling problem.', 'A subsequence of boundary-POS labelling result indicates a word with POS t only if the boundary tag sequence composed of its boundary part conforms to s or bm*e style, and all POS tags in its POS part equal to t. For example, a tag sequence b NN m NN e NN represents a threecharacter word with POS tag NN.', 'The perceptron algorithm introduced into NLP by Collins (2002), is a simple but effective discriminative training method.', 'It has comparable performance to CRFs, while with much faster training.', 'The perceptron has been used in many NLP tasks, such as POS tagging (Collins, 2002), Chinese word segmentation (Ng and Low, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2007) and so on.', 'We trained a character-based perceptron for Chinese Joint S&T, and found that the perceptron itself could achieve considerably high accuracy on segmentation and Joint S&T.', 'In following subsections, we describe the feature templates and the perceptron training algorithm.', 'The feature templates we adopted are selected from those of Ng and Low (2004).', 'To compare with others conveniently, we excluded the ones forbidden by the close test regulation of SIGHAN, for example, Pu(C0), indicating whether character C0 is a punctuation.', 'All feature templates and their instances are shown in Table 1.', 'C represents a Chinese character while the subscript of C indicates its position in the sentence relative to the current character (it has the subscript 0).', 'Templates immediately borrowed from Ng and Low (2004) are listed in the upper column named non-lexical-target.', 'We called them non-lexical-target because predications derived from them can predicate without considering the current character C0.', 'Templates in the column below are expanded from the upper ones.', 'We add a field C0 to each template in the upper column, so that it can carry out predication according to not only the context but also the current character itself.', 'As predications generated from such templates depend on the current character, we name these templates lexical-target.', 'Note that the templates of Ng and Low (2004) have already contained some lexical-target ones.', 'With the two kinds of predications, the perceptron model will do exact predicating to the best of its ability, and can back off to approximately predicating if exact predicating fails.', 'We adopt the perceptron training algorithm of Collins (2002) to learn a discriminative model mapping from inputs x ∈ X to outputs y ∈ Y , where X is the set of sentences in the training corpus and Y is the set of corresponding labelled results.', 'Following Collins, we use a function GEN(x) generating all candidate results of an input x , a representation 4) mapping each training example (x, y) ∈ X × Y to a feature vector 4)(x, y) ∈ Rd, and a parameter vector α� ∈ Rd corresponding to the feature vector. d means the dimension of the vector space, it equals to the amount of features in the model.', 'For an input character sequence x, we aim to find an output F(x) satisfying: vector 4)(x, y) and the parameter vector a.', 'We used the algorithm depicted in Algorithm 1 to tune the parameter vector a.', 'To alleviate overfitting on the training examples, we use the refinement strategy called “averaged parameters” (Collins, 2002) to the algorithm in Algorithm 1.', 'In theory, any useful knowledge can be incorporated into the perceptron directly, besides the characterbased features already adopted.', 'Additional features most widely used are related to word or POS ngrams.', 'However, such features are generated dynamically during the decoding procedure so that the feature space enlarges much more rapidly.', 'Figure 2 shows the growing tendency of feature space with the introduction of these features as well as the character-based ones.', 'We noticed that the templates related to word unigrams and bigrams bring to the feature space an enlargement much rapider than the character-base ones, not to mention the higher-order grams such as trigrams or 4-grams.', 'In addition, even though these higher grams were managed to be used, there still remains another problem: as the current predication relies on the results of prior ones, the decoding procedure has to resort to approximate inference by maintaining a list of N-best candidates at each predication position, which evokes a potential risk to depress the training.', 'To alleviate the drawbacks, we propose a cascaded linear model.', 'It has a two-layer architecture, with a perceptron as the core and another linear model as the outside-layer.', 'Instead of incorporating all features into the perceptron directly, we first trained the perceptron using character-based features, and several other sub-models using additional ones such as word or POS n-grams, then trained the outside-layer linear model using the outputs of these sub-models, including the perceptron.', 'Since the perceptron is fixed during the second training step, the whole training procedure need relative small time and memory cost.', 'The outside-layer linear model, similar to those in SMT, can synthetically utilize different knowledge sources to conduct more accurate comparison between candidates.', 'In this layer, each knowledge source is treated as a feature with a corresponding weight denoting its relative importance.', 'Suppose we have n features gj (j = 1..n) coupled with n corresponding weights wj (j = 1..n), each feature gj gives a score gj(r) to a candidate r, then the total score of r is given by: The decoding procedure aims to find the candidate r* with the highest score: While the mission of the training procedure is to tune the weights wj(j = 1..n) to guarantee that the candidate r with the highest score happens to be the best result with a high probability.', 'As all the sub-models, including the perceptron, are regarded as separate features of the outside-layer linear model, we can train them respectively with special algorithms.', 'In our experiments we trained a 3-gram word language model measuring the fluency of the segmentation result, a 4-gram POS language model functioning as the product of statetransition probabilities in HMM, and a word-POS co-occurrence model describing how much probably a word sequence coexists with a POS sequence.', 'As shown in Figure 1, the character-based perceptron is used as the inside-layer linear model and sends its output to the outside-layer.', 'Besides the output of the perceptron, the outside-layer also receive the outputs of the word LM, the POS LM, the co-occurrence model and a word count penalty which is similar to the translation length penalty in SMT.', 'Language model (LM) provides linguistic probabilities of a word sequence.', 'It is an important measure of fluency of the translation in SMT.', 'Formally, an n-gram word LM approximates the probability of a word sequence W = w1:m with the following product: Notice that a bi-gram POS LM functions as the product of transition probabilities in HMM.', 'Given a training corpus with POS tags, we can train a word-POS co-occurrence model to approximate the probability that the word sequence of the labelled result co-exists with its corresponding POS sequence.', 'Using W = w1:m to denote the word sequence, T = t1:m to denote the corresponding POS sequence, P (T |W) to denote the probability that W is labelled as T, and P(W|T) to denote the probability that T generates W, we can define the cooccurrence model as follows: λwt and λtw denote the corresponding weights of the two components.', 'Suppose the conditional probability Pr(t|w) describes the probability that the word w is labelled as the POS t, while Pr(w|t) describes the probability that the POS t generates the word w, then P(T|W) can be approximated by: Pr(w|t) and Pr(t|w) can be easily acquired by Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) over the corpus.', 'For instance, if the word w appears N times in training corpus and is labelled as POS t for n times, the probability Pr(t|w) can be estimated by the formula below: The probability Pr(w|t) could be estimated through the same approach.', 'To facilitate tuning the weights, we use two components of the co-occurrence model Co(W,T) to represent the co-occurrence probability of W and T, rather than use Co(W, T) itself.', 'In the rest of the paper, we will call them labelling model and generating model respectively.', 'Sequence segmentation and labelling problem can be solved through a viterbi style decoding procedure.', 'In Chinese Joint S&T, the mission of the decoder is to find the boundary-POS labelled sequence with the highest score.', 'Given a Chinese character sequence C1:n, the decoding procedure can proceed in a left-right fashion with a dynamic programming approach.', 'By maintaining a stack of size N at each position i of the sequence, we can preserve the top N best candidate labelled results of subsequence C1:i during decoding.', 'At each position i, we enumerate all possible word-POS pairs by assigning each POS to each possible word formed from the character subsequence spanning length l = L. min(i, K) (K is assigned 20 in all our experiments) and ending at position i, then we derive all candidate results by attaching each word-POS pair p (of length l) to the tail of each candidate result at the prior position of p (position i−l), and select for position i a N-best list of candidate results from all these candidates.', 'When we derive a candidate result from a word-POS pair p and a candidate q at prior position of p, we calculate the scores of the word LM, the POS LM, the labelling probability and the generating probability, Algorithm 2 Decoding algorithm. as well as the score of the perceptron model.', 'In addition, we add the score of the word count penalty as another feature to alleviate the tendency of LMs to favor shorter candidates.', 'By equation 2, we can synthetically evaluate all these scores to perform more accurately comparing between candidates.', 'Algorithm 2 shows the decoding algorithm.', 'Lines 3 — 11 generate a N-best list for each character position i.', 'Line 4 scans words of all possible lengths l (l = 1.. min(i, K), where i points to the current considering character).', 'Line 6 enumerates all POS’s for the word w spanning length l and ending at position i.', 'Line 8 considers each candidate result in N-best list at prior position of the current word.', 'Function D derives the candidate result from the word-POS pair p and the candidate q at prior position of p.', 'We reported results from two set of experiments.', 'The first was conducted to test the performance of the perceptron on segmentation on the corpus from SIGHAN Bakeoff 2, including the Academia Sinica Corpus (AS), the Hong Kong City University Corpus (CityU), the Peking University Corpus (PKU) and the Microsoft Research Corpus (MSR).', 'The second was conducted on the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0 (CTB5.0) to test the performance of the cascaded model on segmentation and Joint S&T.', 'In all experiments, we use the averaged parameters for the perceptrons, and F-measure as the accuracy measure.', 'With precision P and recall R, the balance F-measure is defined as: F = 2PR/(P + R).', 'For convenience of comparing with others, we focus only on the close test, which means that any extra resource is forbidden except the designated training corpus.', 'In order to test the performance of the lexical-target templates and meanwhile determine the best iterations over the training corpus, we randomly chosen 2, 000 shorter sentences (less than 50 words) as the development set and the rest as the training set (84, 294 sentences), then trained a perceptron model named NON-LEX using only nonlexical-target features and another named LEX using both the two kinds of features.', 'Figure 3 shows their learning curves depicting the F-measure on the development set after 1 to 10 training iterations.', 'We found that LEX outperforms NON-LEX with a margin of about 0.002 at each iteration, and its learning curve reaches a tableland at iteration 7.', 'Then we trained LEX on each of the four corpora for 7 iterations.', 'Test results listed in Table 2 shows that this model obtains higher accuracy than the best of SIGHAN Bakeoff 2 in three corpora (AS, CityU and MSR).', 'On the three corpora, it also outperformed the word-based perceptron model of Zhang and Clark (2007).', 'However, the accuracy on PKU corpus is obvious lower than the best score SIGHAN reported, we need to conduct further research on this problem.', 'We turned to experiments on CTB 5.0 to test the performance of the cascaded model.', 'According to the usual practice in syntactic analysis, we choose chapters 1 − 260 (18074 sentences) as training set, chapter 271 − 300 (348 sentences) as test set and chapter 301 − 325 (350 sentences) as development set.', 'At the first step, we conducted a group of contrasting experiments on the core perceptron, the first concentrated on the segmentation regardless of the POS information and reported the F-measure on segmentation only, while the second performed Joint S&T using POS information and reported the F-measure both on segmentation and on Joint S&T.', 'Note that the accuracy of Joint S&T means that a word-POS pair is recognized only if both the boundary tags and the POS’s are correctly labelled.', 'The evaluation results are shown in Table 3.', 'We find that Joint S&T can also improve the segmentation accuracy.', 'However, the F-measure on Joint S&T is obvious lower, about a rate of 95% to the F-measure on segmentation.', 'Similar trend appeared in experiments of Ng and Low (2004), where they conducted experiments on CTB 3.0 and achieved Fmeasure 0.919 on Joint S&T, a ratio of 96% to the F-measure 0.952 on segmentation.', 'As the next step, a group of experiments were conducted to investigate how well the cascaded linear model performs.', 'Here the core perceptron was just the POS+ model in experiments above.', 'Besides this perceptron, other sub-models are trained and used as additional features of the outside-layer linear model.', 'We used SRI Language Modelling Toolkit (Stolcke and Andreas, 2002) to train a 3gram word LM with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998), and a 4-gram POS LM with Witten-Bell smoothing, and we trained a word-POS co-occurrence model simply by MLE without smoothing.', 'To obtain their corresponding weights, we adapted the minimum-error-rate training algorithm (Och, 2003) to train the outside-layer model.', 'In order to inspect how much improvement each feature brings into the cascaded model, every time we removed a feature while retaining others, then retrained the model and tested its performance on the test set.', 'Table 4 shows experiments results.', 'We find that the cascaded model achieves a F-measure increment of about 0.5 points on segmentation and about 0.9 points on Joint S&T, over the perceptron-only model POS+.', 'We also find that the perceptron model functions as the kernel of the outside-layer linear model.', 'Without the perceptron, the cascaded model (if we can still call it “cascaded”) performs poorly on both segmentation and Joint S&T.', 'Among other features, the 4-gram POS LM plays the most important role, removing this feature causes F-measure decrement of 0.33 points on segmentation and 0.71 points on Joint S&T.', 'Another important feature is the labelling model.', 'Without it, the F-measure on segmentation and Joint S&T both suffer a decrement of 0.2 points.', 'The generating model, which functions as that in HMM, brings an improvement of about 0.1 points to each test item.', 'However unlike the three features, the word LM brings very tiny improvement.', 'We suppose that the character-based features used in the perceptron play a similar role as the lowerorder word LM, and it would be helpful if we train a higher-order word LM on a larger scale corpus.', 'Finally, the word count penalty gives improvement to the cascaded model, 0.13 points on segmentation and 0.16 points on Joint S&T.', 'In summary, the cascaded model can utilize these knowledge sources effectively, without causing the feature space of the percptron becoming even larger.', 'Experimental results show that, it achieves obvious improvement over the perceptron-only model, about from 0.973 to 0.978 on segmentation, and from 0.925 to 0.934 on Joint S&T, with error reductions of 18.5% and 12% respectively.', 'We proposed a cascaded linear model for Chinese Joint S&T.', 'Under this model, many knowledge sources that may be intractable to be incorporated into the perceptron directly, can be utilized effectively in the outside-layer linear model.', 'This is a substitute method to use both local and non-local features, and it would be especially useful when the training corpus is very large.', 'However, can the perceptron incorporate all the knowledge used in the outside-layer linear model?', 'If this cascaded linear model were chosen, could more accurate generative models (LMs, word-POS co-occurrence model) be obtained by training on large scale corpus even if the corpus is not correctly labelled entirely, or by self-training on raw corpus in a similar approach to that of McClosky (2006)?', 'In addition, all knowledge sources we used in the core perceptron and the outside-layer linear model come from the training corpus, whereas many open knowledge sources (lexicon etc.) can be used to improve performance (Ng and Low, 2004).', 'How can we utilize these knowledge sources effectively?', 'We will investigate these problems in the following work.', 'This work was done while L.

most similar to that of the focus word is retrieved from the memory, which is indexed on the basis of the Information Gain of each feature, and the accompanying tag is selected.', 'The system used here has access to information about the focus word and the two positions before and after, at least for known words.', 'For unknown words, the single position before and after, three suffix letters,

characters such as ""$"" in tag names have been replaced.', 'However, there has also been some retokenization: genitive markers have been split off and the negative marker ""n\'t"" has been reattached.', 'An example sentence tagged with the resulting tagset is: The ATI singular or plural article Lord NPT singular titular noun Major NPT singular titular noun extended VBD past tense of

of all tuggers.', 'Both Tune and Test contain around 2.5% new tokens (wrt Train) and a further 0.2% known tokens with new tags.', 'The data in Train (for individual tuggers) and Tune (for combination tuggers) is to be the only information used in tagger construction: all components of all tuggers (lexicon, context statistics, etc.) are to be entirely data driven and no manual adjustments are to be done.', 'The data in Test is never to be inspected in detail but only used as a benchmark tagging for quality measurement.', 'In order to see whether combination of the component tuggers is likely to lead to improvements of tagging quality, we first examine the results of the individual taggers when applied to Tune.', 'As far as we know this is also one of the first rigorous measurements of the relative quality of different tagger generators, using a single tagset and dataset and identical circumstances.', 'The quality of the individual tuggers (cf.', 'Table 2 below) certainly still leaves room for improvement, although tagger E surprises us with an accuracy well above any results reported so far and makes us less confident about the gain to be accomplished with combination.', 'However, that there is room for improvement is not enough.', 'As explained above, for combination to lead to improvement, the component taggers must differ in the errors that they make.', 'That this is indeed the case can be seen in Table 1.', 'It shows that for 99.22% of Tune, at least one tagger selects the correct tag.', 'However, it is unlikely that we will be able to identify this 4This implies that it is impossible to note if errors counted against a tagger are in fact errors in the benchmark tagging.', 'We accept that we are measuring quality in relation to a specific tagging rather than the

sections we examine a number of them.', 'The accuracy measurements for all of them are listed in Table 2.', '5 The most straightforward selection method is an n-way vote.', 'Each tagger is allowed to vote for the tag of its choice and the tag with the highest number of votes is selected.', '6 The question is how large a vote we allow each tagger.', 'The most democratic option is to give each tagger one vote (Majority).', 'However, it appears more useful to give more weight to taggers which have proved their quality.', 'This can be general quality, e.g. each tagger votes its overall precision (TotPrecision), or quality in relation to the current situation, e.g. each tagger votes its precision on the suggested tag (Tag- Precision).', ""The information about each tagger's quality is derived from an inspection of its results on Tune."", '5For any tag X, precision measures which percentage of the tokens tagged X by the tagger are also tagged X in the benchmark and recall measures which percentage of the tokens tagged X in the benchmark are also tagged X by the tagger.', 'When abstracting away from individual tags, precision and recall are equal and measure how many tokens are tagged correctly; in this case we also use the more generic term accuracy.', '6In our experiment, a random selection from among the winning tags is made whenever there is a tie.', 'Table 2: Accuracy of individual taggers and combination methods.', 'But we have even more information on how well the taggers perform.', 'We not only know whether we should believe what they propose (precision) but also know how often they fail to recognize the correct tag (recall).', 'This information can be used by forcing each tagger also to add to the vote for tags suggested by the opposition, by an amount equal to 1 minus the recall on the opposing tag (Precision-Recall).', 'As it turns out~ all voting systems outperform the best single tagger, E. 7 Also, the best voting system is the one in which the most specific information is used, Precision-Recall.', 'However, specific information is not always superior, for TotPrecision scores higher than TagPrecision.', 'This might be explained by the fact that recall information is missing (for overall performance this does not matter, since recall is equal to precision).', ""7Even the worst combinator, Majority, is significantly better than E: using McNemar's chi-square, p--0."", 'Pairwise Voting So far, we have only used information on the performance of individual taggers.', 'A next step is to examine them in pairs.', 'We can investigate all situations where one tagger suggests T1 and the other T2 and estimate the probability that in this situation the tag should actually be Tx.', 'When combining the taggers, every tagger pair is taken in turn and allowed to vote (with the probability described above) for each possible tag, i.e. not just the ones suggested by the component taggers.', 'If a tag pair T1T2 has never been observed in Tune, we fall back on information on the individual taggers, viz.', 'the probability of each tag Tx given that the tagger suggested tag Ti.', 'Note that with this method (and those in the next section) a tag suggested by a minority (or even none) of the taggers still has a chance to win.', 'In principle, this could remove the restriction of gain only in 22 and 1111 cases.', 'In practice, the chance to beat a majority is very slight indeed and we should not get our hopes up too high that this should happen very often.', 'When used on Test, the pairwise voting strategy (TagPair) clearly outperforms the other voting strategies, 8 but does not yet approach the level where all tying majority votes are handled correctly (98.31%).', 'Stacked classifiers From the measurements so far it appears that the use of more detailed information leads to a better accuracy improvement.', 'It ought therefore to be advantageous to step away from the underlying mechanism of voting and to model the situations observed in Tune more closely.', 'The practice of feeding the outputs of a number of classifiers as features for a next learner sit is significantly better than the runner-up (Precision-Recall) with p=0.', 'is usually called stacking (Wolpert 1992).', 'The second stage can be provided with the first level outputs, and with additional information, e.g. about the original input pattern.', 'The first choice for this is to use a Memory- Based second level learner.', 'In the basic version (Tags), each case consists of the tags suggested by the component taggers and the correct tag.', 'In the more advanced versions we also add information about the word in question (Tags+Word) and the tags suggested by all taggers for the previous and the next position (Tags+Context).', 'For the first two the similarity metric used during tagging is a straightforward overlap count; for the third we need to use an Information Gain weighting (Daelemans ct al. 1997).', 'Surprisingly, none of the Memory-Based based methods reaches the quality of TagPair.', '9 The explanation for this can be found when we examine the differences within the Memory- Based general strategy: the more feature information is stored, the higher the accuracy on Tune, but the lower the accuracy on Test.', 'This is most likely an overtraining effect: Tune is probably too small to collect case bases which can leverage the stacking effect convincingly, especially since only 7.51% of the second stage material shows disagreement between the featured tags.', 'To examine if the overtraining effects are specific to this particular second level classifier, we also used the C5.0 system, a commercial version of the well-known program C4.5 (Quinlan 1993) for the induction of decision trees, on the same training material.', '1° Because C5.0 prunes the decision tree, the overfitting of training material (Tune) is less than with Memory-Based learning, but the results on Test are also worse.', 'We conjecture that pruning is not beneficial when the interesting cases are very rare.', 'To realise the benefits of stacking, either more data is needed or a second stage classifier that is better suited to this type of problem.', '9Tags (Memory-Based) scores significantly worse than TagPair (p=0.0274) and not significantly better than Precision-Recall (p=0.2766).',

or 2) for each indicator; the candidate with the highest aggregate score is proposed as the anteÂ\xad cedent.', 'The antecedent indicators have been identiÂ\xad fied empirically and are related to salience (definiteness, givenness, indicating verbs, lexical reiteration, section heading preference, ""nonÂ\xad prepositional"" noun phrases), to structural matches (collocation, immediate reference), to referential distance or to preference of terms.', 'Whilst some of the indicators are more genre-specific (term preferÂ\xad ence) and others are less genre-specific (""immediate reference""), the majority appear to be genreÂ\xad independent.', 'In the following we shall outline some the indicators used and shall illustrate them by exÂ\xad amples.', 'Definiteness Definite noun phrases in previous sentences are more likely antecedents of pronominal anaphors than indefinite ones (definite noun phrases score 0 and indefinite ones are penalised by -1).', 'We regard a noun phrase as definite if the head noun is modified by a definite article, or by demonstrative or possesÂ\xad sive pronouns.', ""This rule is ignored if there are no definite articles, possessive or

illustrate, identify, summarise, examine, describe, define, show, check, develop, review, reÂ\xad port, outline, consider, investigate, explore, assess, analyse, synthesise, study, survey, deal, cover}, we consider the first NP following it as the preferred anÂ\xad tecedent (scores 1 and 0).', 'Empirical evidence sugÂ\xad gests that because of the salience of the noun phrases which follow them, the verbs listed above are particularly good indicators.', 'Lexical reiteration Lexically reiterated items are likely candidates for antecedent (a NP scores 2 if is repeated within the same paragraph twice or more, 1 if repeated once and 0 if not).', 'Lexically reiterated items include reÂ\xad peated synonymous noun phrases which may often be preceded by definite articles or demonstratives.', 'Also, a sequence of noun phrases with the same head counts as lexical reiteration (e.g. ""toner bottle"", ""bottle of toner"", ""the bottle"").', 'Section heading preference If a noun phrase occurs in the heading of the section, part of which is the current sentence, then we conÂ\xad sider it as the preferred candidate (1, 0).', '""Non-prepositional"" noun phrases A ""pure"", ""non-prepositional"" noun phrase is given a higher preference than a noun phrase which is part of a prepositional phrase (0, -1 ).', 'Example: Insert the cassettei into the VCR making sure iti is suitable for the length of recording.', 'Here ""the VCR"" is penalised (-1) for being part of the prepositional phrase ""into the VCR"".', 'This preference can be explained in terms of saliÂ\xad ence from the point of view of the centering theory.', 'The latter proposes the ranking ""subject, direct obÂ\xad ject, indirect object"" (Brennan et al. 1987) and noun phrases which are parts of prepositional phrases are usually indirect objects.', 'Collocation pattern preference This preference is given to candidates which have an identical collocation pattern with a pronoun (2,0).', 'The collocation preference here is restricted to the patterns ""noun phrase (pronoun), verb"" and ""verb, noun phrase (pronoun)"".', 'Owing to lack of syntactic information, this preference is somewhat weaker than the collocation preference described in (Dagan & ltai 1990).', 'Example: Press the keyi down and turn the volume up...', 'Press iti again.', 'Immediate reference In technical manuals the ""immediate reference"" clue can often be useful in identifying the antecedent.', 'The heuristics used is that in constructions of the form ""...(You) V 1 NP ... con (you) V 2 it (con (you) V3 it)"", where con e {and/or/before/after...}, the noun phrase immediately after V 1 is a very likely candidate for antecedent of the pronoun ""it"" immeÂ\xad diately following V2 and is therefore given

correspond to the main sense.', 'Table 1 above shows the number of verbs in each class at the end of this process.', 'Of these verbs, 20 from each class were randomly selected to use as training data for our supervised experiments in Joanis and Stevenson (2003).', 'We began with this same set of 20 verbs per class for our current work.', 'We then replaced 10 of the 260 verbs (4%) to enable us to

object of a verb, as well as the PPs potentially associated with it.', 'Indirect objects are identified by a less sophisticated (and even noisier) method, simply assuming that two consecutive NPs after the verb constitute a double object frame.', 'From these extracted slots, we calculate the features described in Section 2, yielding a vector of 220 normalized counts for each verb, which forms the input to our machine learning experiments.', '4.1 Clustering Parameters.', 'We used the hierarchical clustering command in Matlab, which implements bottom-up agglomerative clustering, for all our unsupervised experiments.', 'In performing hierarchical clustering, both a vector distance measure and a cluster distance (â\x80\x9clinkageâ\x80\x9d) measure are specified.', 'We used the simple Euclidean distance for the former, and Ward linkage for the latter.', 'Ward linkage essentially minimizes the distances of all cluster points to the centroid, and thus is less sensitive to outliers than some other methods.', 'We chose hierarchical clustering because it may be possible to find coherent subclusters of verbs even when there are not exactly good clusters, where is the number of classes.', 'To explore this, we can induce any number of clusters by making a cut at a particular level in the clustering hierarchy.', 'In the experiments here, however, we report only results for , since we found no principled way of automatically determining a good cutoff.', 'However, we did experiment with (as in Strehl et al., 2000), and found that performance was generally better (even on our measure, described below, that discounts oversplitting).', 'This supports our intuition that the approach may enable us to find more consistent clusters at a finer grain, without too much fragmentation.', '4.2 Evaluation Measures.', 'We use three separate evaluation measures, that tap into very different properties of the clusterings.', '4.2.1 Accuracy We can assign each cluster the class label of the majority of its members.', 'Then for all verbs , consider to be classified correctly if Class( )=ClusterLabel( ), where Class( ) is the actual class of and ClusterLabel( ) is the label assigned to the cluster in which is placed.', 'Then accuracy has the standard definition:2 2 is equivalent to the weighted mean precision of the clusters, weighted according to cluster size.',

usefulness in practice of a clusteringâ\x80\x94that is, if one were to use the clustering as a classification, this measure tells how accurate overall the class assignments would be.', 'The theoretical maximum is, of course, 1.', 'To calculate a random baseline, we evaluated 10,000 random clusterings with the same number of verbs and classes as in each of our experimental tasks.', 'Because the achieved depends on the precise size of clusters, we calculated mean over the best scenario (with equal-sized clusters), yielding a conservative estimate (i.e., an upper bound) of the baseline.', 'These figures are reported with our results in Table 2 below.', '4.2.2 Adjusted Rand Measure Accuracy can be relatively high for a clustering when a few clusters are very good, and others are not good.', 'Our second measure, the adjusted Rand measure used by Schulte im Walde (2003), instead gives a measure of how consistent the given clustering is overall with respect to the gold

17%).', 'Moreover, the value for the manually selected features is almost always very much higher than that of the full feature set, indicating that the subset of features is more focused on the properties that lead to a better separation of the data.', 'This performance comparison tentatively suggests that good feature selection can be helpful in our task.', 'However, it is important to find a method that does not depend on having an existing classification, since we are interested in applying the approach when such a classification does not exist.', 'In the next two sections, we present unsupervised and minimally supervised approaches to this problem.', '5.3 Unsupervised Feature Selection.', 'In order to deal with excessive dimensionality, Dash et al.', '(1997) propose an unsupervised method to rank a set of features according to their ability to organize the data in space, based on an entropy measure they devise.', 'Unfortunately, this promising method did not prove practical for our data.', 'We performed a number of experiments in which we tested the performance of each feature set from cardinality 1 to the total number of features, where each set of size differs from the set of size in the addition of the feature with next highest rank (according to the proposed entropy measure).', 'Many feature sets performed very well, and some far outperformed our best results using other feature selection methods.', 'However, across our 10 experimental tasks, there was no consistent range of feature ranks or feature set sizes that was correlated with good performance.', 'While we could have selected a threshold that might work reasonably well with our data, we would have little confidence that it would work well in general, considering the inconsistent pattern of results.', '5.4 Semi-Supervised Feature Selection.', 'Unsupervised methods such as Dash et al.â\x80\x99s (1997) are appealing because they require no knowledge external to the data.', 'However, in many aspects of computational linguistics, it has been found that a small amount of labelled data contains sufficient information to allow us to go beyond the limits of completely unsupervised approaches.', 'In our domain in particular, verb class discovery â\x80\x9cin a vacuumâ\x80\x9d is not necessary.', 'A plausible scenario is that researchers would have examples of verbs which they believe fall into different classes of interest, and they want to separate other verbs along the same lines.', 'To model this kind of approach, we selected a sample of five seed verbs from each class.', 'Each set of verbs was judged (by the authorsâ\x80\x99 intuition alone) to be â\x80\x9crepresentativeâ\x80\x9d of the class.', 'We purposely did not carry out any linguistic analysis, although we did check that each verb was reasonably frequent (with log frequencies ranging from 2.6 to 5.1).', 'For each experimental task, we ran our supervised Table 3: Feature counts for Ling and Seed feature sets.', 'learner (C5.0) on the seed verbs for those classes, in a 5-fold cross-validation (without boosting).', 'We extracted from the resulting decision trees the union of all features used, which formed the reduced feature set for that task.', 'Each clustering experiment used the full set of 20 verbs per class; i.e., seed verbs were included, following our proposed model of guided verb class discovery.5 The results using these feature sets are shown in the third subcolumn (Seed) under our three evaluation measures in Table 2.', 'This feature selection method is highly successful, outperforming the full feature set (Full) on and on most tasks, and performing the same or very close on the remainder.', 'Moreover, the seed set of features outperforms the manually selected set (Ling) on over half the tasks.', 'More importantly, the Seed set shows a mean overall reduction in error rate (over Base ) of 28%, compared to 17% for the Ling set.', 'The increased reduction in error rate is particularly striking for the 2-way tasks, of 37% for the Seed set compared to 20% for the Ling set.', 'Another striking result is the difference in values, which are very much higher than those for Ling (which are in turn much higher than for Full).', 'Thus, not only do we see a sizeable increase in performance, we also obtain tighter and better separated clusters with our proposed feature selection approach.', '5.5 Further Discussion.', 'In our clustering experiments, we find that smaller subsets of features generally perform better than the full set of features.', '(See Table 3 for the number of features in the Ling and Seed sets.)', 'However, not just any small set of features is adequate.', 'We ran 50 experiments using randomly selected sets of features of cardinality , where 5We also tried directly applying the mutual information (MI) measure used in decision-tree induction (Quinlan, 1986).', 'We calculated the MI of each feature with respect to the classification of the seed verbs, and computed clusterings using the features above a certain MI threshold.', 'This method did not work as well as running C5.0, which presumably captures important feature interactions that are ignored in the individual MI calculations.', 'is the number of classes (a simple linear function roughly approximating the number of features in the Seed sets).', 'Mean over these clusterings was much lower than for the Seed sets, and was extremely low (below .08 in all cases).', 'Interestingly, was generally very high, indicating that there is structure in the data, but not what matches our classification.', 'This confirms that appropriate feature selection, and not just a small number of features, is important for the task of verb class discovery.', 'We also find that our semi-supervised method (Seed) is linguistically plausible, and performs as well as or better than features manually determined based on linguistic knowledge (Ling).', 'We might also ask, would any subset of verbs do as well?', 'To answer this, we ran experiments using 50 different randomly selected seed verb sets for each class.', 'We found that the mean and values are the same as that of the Seed set reported above, but mean is a little lower.', 'We tentatively conclude that, yes, any subset of verbs of the appropriate class may be sufficient as a seed set, although some sets are better than others.', 'This is promising for our method, as it shows that the precise selection of a seed set of verbs is not crucial to the success of the semi-supervised approach.', 'Using the same measure as ours, Stevenson and Merlo (1999) achieved performance in clustering very close to that of their supervised classification.', 'However, their study used a small set of five features manually devised for a set of three particular classes.', 'Our feature set is essentially a generalization of theirs, but in scaling up the feature space to be useful across English verb classes in general, we necessarily face a dimensionality problem that did not arise in their research.', 'Schulte im Walde and Brew (2002) and Schulte im Walde (2003), on the other hand, use a larger set of features intended to be useful for a broad number of classes, as in our work.', 'The scores of Schulte im Walde (2003) range from .09 to .18, while ours range from .02 to .34, with a mean of .17 across all tasks.', 'However, Schulte im Waldeâ\x80\x99s features rely on accurate subcategorization statistics, and her experiments include a much larger set of classes (around 40), each with a much smaller number of verbs (average around 4).', 'Performance differences may be due to the types of features (ours are noisier, but capture information beyond subcat), or due to the number or size of classes.', 'While our results generally decrease with an increase in the number of classes, indicating that our tasks in general may be â\x80\x9ceasierâ\x80\x9d than her 40-way distinction, our classes also have many more members (20 versus an average of 4) that need to be grouped together.', 'It is a question for future research to explore the effect of these variables in clustering performance.', 'We have explored manual, unsupervised, and semi- supervised methods for feature selection in a clustering approach for verb class discovery.', 'We find that manual selection of a subset of features based on the known classification performs better than using a full set of noisy features, demonstrating the potential benefit of feature selection in our task.', 'An unsupervised method we tried (Dash et al., 1997) did not prove useful, because of the problem of having no consistent threshold for feature inclusion.', 'We instead proposed a semi-supervised method in which a seed set of verbs is chosen for training a supervised classifier, from which the useful features are extracted for use in clustering.', 'We showed that this feature set outperformed both the full and the manually selected sets of features on all three of our clustering evaluation metrics.', 'Furthermore, the method is relatively insensitive to the precise makeup of the selected seed set.', 'As successful as our seed set of features is, it still does not achieve the accuracy of a supervised learner.', 'More research is needed on the definition of the general feature space, as well as on the methods for selecting a more useful set of features for clustering.', 'Furthermore, we might question the clustering approach itself, in the context of verb class discovery.', 'Rather than trying to separate a set of new verbs into coherent clusters, we suggest that it may be useful to perform a nearest-neighbour type of classification using a seed set, asking for each new verb â\x80\x9cis it like these or not?â\x80\x9d In some ways our current clustering task is too easy, because all of the verbs are from one of the target classes.', 'In other ways, however, it is too difficult: the learner has to distinguish multiple classes, rather than focus on the important properties of a single class.', 'Our next step is to explore these issues, and investigate other methods appropriate to the practical problem of grouping verbs in a new language.', 'We are indebted to Allan Jepson for helpful discussions and suggestions.', 'We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of NSERC of

syntactic annotation of German newspaper text, using the Annotate3 tool for interactive construction of tree structures.', '2.3 Rhetorical structure.', 'All commentaries have been annotated with rhetorical structure, using RSTTool4 and the definitions of discourse relations provided by Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann, Thompson 1988).', 'Two annotators received training with the RST definitions and started the process with a first set of 10 texts, the results of which were intensively discussed and revised.', 'Then, the remaining texts were annotated and cross-validated, always with discussions among the annotators.', 'Thus we opted not to take the step of creating more precise written annotation guidelines (as (Carlson, Marcu 2001) did for English), which would then allow for measuring inter-annotator agreement.', 'The motivation for our more informal approach was the intuition that there are so many open problems in rhetorical analysis (and more so for German than for English; see below) that the main task is qualitative investigation, whereas rigorous quantitative analyses should be performed at a later stage.', 'One conclusion drawn from this annotation effort was that for humans and machines alike, 2 www.sfs.nphil.unituebingen.de/Elwis/stts/ stts.html 3 www.coli.unisb.de/sfb378/negra-corpus/annotate.', 'html 4 www.wagsoft.com/RSTTool assigning rhetorical relations is a process loaded with ambiguity and, possibly, subjectivity.', 'We respond to this on the one hand with a format for its underspecification (see 2.4) and on the other hand with an additional level of annotation that attends only to connectives and their scopes (see 2.5), which is intended as an intermediate step on the long road towards a systematic and objective treatment of rhetorical structure.', '2.4 Underspecified rhetorical structure.', 'While RST (Mann, Thompson 1988) proposed that a single relation hold between adjacent text segments, SDRT (Asher, Lascarides 2003) maintains that multiple relations may hold simultaneously.', 'Within the RST â\x80\x9cuser communityâ\x80\x9d there has also been discussion whether two levels of discourse structure should not be systematically distinguished (intentional versus informational).', 'Some relations are signalled by subordinating conjunctions, which clearly demarcate the range of the text spans related (matrix clause, embedded clause).', 'When the signal is a coordinating conjunction, the second span is usually the clause following the conjunction; the first span is often the clause preceding it, but sometimes stretches further back.', 'When the connective is an adverbial, there is much less clarity as to the range of the spans.', 'Assigning rhetorical relations thus poses questions that can often be answered only subjectively.', 'Our annotators pointed out that very often they made almost random decisions as to what relation to choose, and where to locate the boundary of a span.', '(Carlson, Marcu 2001) responded to this situation with relatively precise (and therefore long!)', 'annotation guidelines that tell annotators what to do in case of doubt.', 'Quite often, though, these directives fulfill the goal of increasing annotator agreement without in fact settling the theoretical question; i.e., the directives are clear but not always very well motivated.', 'In (Reitter, Stede 2003) we went a different way and suggested URML5, an XML format for underspecifying rhetorical structure: a number of relations can be assigned instead of a single one, competing analyses can be represented with shared forests.', 'The rhetorical structure annotations of PCC have all been converted to URML.', 'There are still some open issues to be resolved with the format, but it represents a first step.', 'What ought to be developed now is an annotation tool that can make use of the format, allow for underspecified annotations and visualize them accordingly.', '2.5 Connectives with scopes.', 'For the â\x80\x98coreâ\x80\x99 portion of PCC, we found that on average, 35% of the coherence relations in our RST annotations are explicitly signalled by a lexical connective.6 When adding the fact that connectives are often ambiguous, one has to conclude that prospects for an automatic analysis of rhetorical structure using shallow methods (i.e., relying largely on connectives) are not bright â\x80\x94 but see Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below.', 'Still, for both human and automatic rhetorical analysis, connectives are the most important source of surface information.', 'We thus decided to pay specific attention to them and introduce an annotation layer for connectives and their scopes.', 'This was also inspired by the work on the Penn Discourse Tree Bank7 , which follows similar goals for English.', 'For effectively annotating connectives/scopes, we found that existing annotation tools were not well-suited, for two reasons: â\x80¢ Some tools are dedicated to modes of annotation (e.g., tiers), which could only quite un-intuitively be used for connectives and scopes.', 'â\x80¢ Some tools would allow for the desired annotation mode, but are so complicated (they can be used for many other purposes as well) that annotators take a long time getting used to them.', '5 â\x80\x98Underspecified Rhetorical Markup Languageâ\x80\x99 6 This confirms the figure given by (Schauer, Hahn.', 'Consequently, we implemented our own annotation tool ConAno in Java (Stede, Heintze 2004), which provides specifically the functionality needed for our purpose.', 'It reads a file with a list of German connectives, and when a text is opened for annotation, it highlights all the words that show up in this list; these will be all the potential connectives.', 'The annotator can then â\x80\x9cclick awayâ\x80\x9d those words that are here not used as connectives (such as the conjunction und (â\x80\x98andâ\x80\x99) used in lists, or many adverbials that are ambiguous between connective and discourse particle).', 'Then, moving from connective to connective, ConAno sometimes offers suggestions for its scope (using heuristics like â\x80\x98for sub- junctor, mark all words up to the next comma as the first segmentâ\x80\x99), which the annotator can accept with a mouseclick or overwrite, marking instead the correct scope with the mouse.', 'When finished, the whole material is written into an XML-structured annotation file.', '2.6 Co-reference.', 'We developed a first version of annotation guidelines for co-reference in PCC (Gross 2003), which served as basis for annotating the core corpus but have not been empirically evaluated for inter-annotator agreement yet.', 'The tool we use is MMAX8, which has been specifically designed for marking co-reference.', 'Upon identifying an anaphoric expression (currently restricted to: pronouns, prepositional adverbs, definite noun phrases), the an- notator first marks the antecedent expression (currently restricted to: various kinds of noun phrases, prepositional phrases, verb phrases, sentences) and then establishes the link between the two.', 'Links can be of two different kinds: anaphoric or bridging (definite noun phrases picking up an antecedent via world-knowledge).', 'â\x80¢ Anaphoric links: the annotator is asked to specify whether the anaphor is a repetition, partial repetition, pronoun, epithet (e.g., Andy Warhol â\x80\x93 the PopArt artist), or is-a (e.g., Andy Warhol was often hunted by photographers.', 'This fact annoyed especially his dog...).', 'â\x80¢ Bridging links: the annotator is asked to specify the type as part-whole, cause-effect (e.g., She had an accident.', 'The wounds are still healing.), entity-attribute (e.g., She 2001), who determined that in their corpus of German computer tests, 38% of relations were lexically signalled.', '7 www.cis.upenn.edu/â\x88¼pdtb/ 8 www.eml-research.de/english/Research/NLP/ Downloads

querying the annoated text, we make use of the Annis Linguistic Database developed in our group for a large research effort (â\x80\x98Sonderforschungsbereichâ\x80\x99) revolving around 9 2.7 Information structure.', 'information structure.', 'The implementation is In a similar effort, (GÂ¨otze 2003) developed a proposal for the theory-neutral annotation of information structure (IS) â\x80\x94 a notoriously difficult area with plenty of conflicting and overlapping terminological conceptions.', 'And indeed, converging on annotation guidelines is even more difficult than it is with co-reference.', 'Like in the co-reference annotation, GÂ¨otzeâ\x80\x99s proposal has been applied by two annotators to the core corpus but it has not been systematically evaluated yet.', 'We use MMAX for this annotation as well.', 'Here, annotation proceeds in two phases: first, the domains and the units of IS are marked as such.', 'The domains are the linguistic spans that are to receive an IS-partitioning, and the units are the (smaller) spans that can play a role as a constituent of such a partitioning.', 'Among the IS-units, the referring expressions are marked as such and will in the second phase receive a label for cognitive status (active, accessible- text, accessible-situation, inferrable, inactive).', 'They are also labelled for their topicality (yes / no), and this annotation is accompanied by a confidence value assigned by the annotator (since it is a more subjective matter).', 'Finally, the focus/background partition is annotated, together with the focus question that elicits the corresponding answer.', 'Asking the annotator to also formulate the question is a way of arriving at more reproducible decisions.', 'For all these annotation taks, GÂ¨otze developed a series of questions (essentially a decision tree) designed to lead the annotator to the ap propriate judgement.', 'Having explained the various layers of annotation in PCC, we now turn to the question what all this might be good for.', 'This concerns on the one hand the basic question of retrieval, i.e. searching for information across the annotation layers (see 3.1).', 'On the other hand, we are interested in the application of rhetorical analysis or â\x80\x98discourse parsingâ\x80\x99 (3.2 and 3.3), in text generation (3.4), and in exploiting the corpus for the development of improved models of discourse structure (3.5).', 'basically complete, yet some improvements and extensions are still under way.', 'The web-based Annis imports data in a variety of XML formats and tagsets and displays it in a tier-orientedway (optionally, trees can be drawn more ele gantly in a separate window).', 'Figure 2 shows a screenshot (which is of somewhat limited value, though, as color plays a major role in signalling the different statuses of the information).', 'In the small window on the left, search queries can be entered, here one for an NP that has been annotated on the co-reference layer as bridging.', 'The portions of information in the large window can be individually clicked visible or invisible; here we have chosen to see (from top to bottom) â\x80¢ the full text, â\x80¢ the annotation values for the activated annotation set (co-reference), â\x80¢ the actual annotation tiers, and â\x80¢ the portion of text currently â\x80\x98in focusâ\x80\x99 (which also appears underlined in the full text).', 'Different annotations of the same text are mapped into the same data structure, so that search queries can be formulated across annotation levels.', 'Thus it is possible, for illustration, to look for a noun phrase (syntax tier) marked as topic (information structure tier) that is in a bridging relation (co-reference tier) to some other noun phrase.', '3.2 Stochastic rhetorical analysis.', 'In an experiment on automatic rhetorical parsing, the RST-annotations and PoS tags were used by (Reitter 2003) as a training corpus for statistical classification with Support Vector Machines.', 'Since 170 annotated texts constitute a fairly small training set, Reitter found that an overall recognition accuracy of 39% could be achieved using his method.', 'For the English RST-annotated corpus that is made available via LDC, his corresponding result is 62%.', 'Future work along these lines will incorporate other layers of annotation, in particular the syntax information.', '9 www.ling.unipotsdam.de/sfb/ Figure 2: Screenshot of Annis Linguistic Database 3.3 Symbolic and knowledge-based.', 'rhetorical analysis We are experimenting with a hybrid statistical and knowledge-based system for discourse parsing and summarization (Stede 2003), (Hanneforth et al. 2003), again targeting the genre of commentaries.', 'The idea is to have a pipeline of shallow-analysis modules (tagging, chunk- ing, discourse parsing based on connectives) and map the resulting underspecified rhetorical tree (see Section 2.4) into a knowledge base that may contain domain and world knowledge for enriching the representation, e.g., to resolve references that cannot be handled by shallow methods, or to hypothesize coherence relations.', 'In the rhetorical tree, nuclearity information is then used to extract a â\x80\x9ckernel treeâ\x80\x9d that supposedly represents the key information from which the summary can be generated (which in turn may involve co-reference information, as we want to avoid dangling pronouns in a summary).', 'Thus we are interested not in extraction, but actual generation from representations that may be developed to different degrees of granularity.', 'In order to evaluate and advance this approach, it helps to feed into the knowledge base data that is already enriched with some of the desired information â\x80\x94 as in PCC.', 'That is, we can use the discourse parser on PCC texts, emulating for instance a â\x80\x9cco-reference oracleâ\x80\x9d that adds the information from our co-reference annotations.', 'The knowledge base then can be tested for its relation-inference capabilities on the basis of full-blown co-reference information.', 'Conversely, we can use the full rhetorical tree from the annotations and tune the co-reference module.', 'The general idea for the knowledge- based part is to have the system use as much information as it can find at its disposal to produce a target representation as specific as possible and as underspecified as necessary.', 'For developing these mechanisms, the possibility to feed in hand-annotated information is very useful.', '3.4 Salience-based text generation.', 'Text generation, or at least the two phases of text planning and sentence planning, is a process driven partly by well-motivated choices (e.g., use this lexeme X rather than that more colloquial near-synonym Y ) and partly by con tation like that of PCC can be exploited to look for correlations in particular between syntactic structure, choice of referring expressions, and sentence-internal information structure.', 'A different but supplementary perspective on discourse-based information structure is taken 11ventionalized patterns (e.g., order of informa by one of our partner projects, which is inter tion in news reports).', 'And then there are decisions that systems typically hard-wire, because the linguistic motivation for making them is not well understood yet.', 'Preferences for constituent order (especially in languages with relatively free word order) often belong to this group.', 'Trying to integrate constituent ordering and choice of referring expressions, (Chiarcos 2003) developed a numerical model of salience propagation that captures various factors of authorâ\x80\x99s intentions and of information structure for ordering sentences as well as smaller constituents, and picking appropriate referring expressions.10 Chiarcos used the PCC annotations of co-reference and information structure to compute his numerical models for salience projection across the generated texts.', '3.5 Improved models of discourse.', 'structure Besides the applications just sketched, the over- arching goal of developing the PCC is to build up an empirical basis for investigating phenomena of discourse structure.', 'One key issue here is to seek a discourse-based model of information structure.', 'Since DaneË\x87sâ\x80\x99 proposals of â\x80\x98thematic development patternsâ\x80\x99, a few suggestions have been made as to the existence of a level of discourse structure that would predict the information structure of sentences within texts.', '(Hartmann 1984), for example, used the term Reliefgebung to characterize the distibution of main and minor information in texts (similar to the notion of nuclearity in RST).', '(Brandt 1996) extended these ideas toward a conception of kommunikative Gewichtung (â\x80\x98communicative-weight assignmentâ\x80\x99).', 'A different notion of information structure, is used in work such as that of (?), who tried to characterize felicitous constituent ordering (theme choice, in particular) that leads to texts presenting information in a natural, â\x80\x9cflowingâ\x80\x9d way rather than with abrupt shifts of attention.', 'â\x80\x94ested in correlations between prosody and dis course structure.', 'A number of PCC commentaries will be read by professional news speakers and prosodic features be annotated, so that the various annotation layers can be set into correspondence with intonation patterns.', 'In focus is in particular the correlation with rhetorical structure, i.e., the question whether specific rhetorical relations â\x80\x94 or groups of relations in particular configurations â\x80\x94 are signalled by speakers with prosodic means.', 'Besides information structure, the second main goal is to enhance current models of rhetorical structure.', 'As already pointed out in Section 2.4, current theories diverge not only on the number and definition of relations but also on apects of structure, i.e., whether a tree is sufficient as a representational device or general graphs are required (and if so, whether any restrictions can be placed on these graphâ\x80\x99s

aid in finding models of discourse structure that are more explanatory and can be empirically supported.', 'The PCC is not the result of a funded project.', 'Instead, the designs of the various annotation layers and the actual annotation work are results of a series of diploma theses, of studentsâ\x80\x99 work in course projects, and to some extent of paid assistentships.', 'This means that the PCC cannot grow particularly quickly.', 'After the first step towards breadth had been taken with the PoS-tagging, RST annotation, and URML conversion of the entire corpus of 170 texts12 , emphasis shifted towards depth.', 'Hence we decided to select ten commentaries to form a â\x80\x98core corpusâ\x80\x99, for which the entire range of annotation levels was realized, so that experiments with multi-level querying could commence.', 'Cur In order to ground such approaches in linguistic observation and description, a multi-level anno 10 For an exposition of the idea as

(2003), which de serves special mention here.', 'rently, some annotations (in particular the connectives and scopes) have already moved beyond the core corpus; the others will grow step by step.', 'The kind of annotation work presented here would clearly benefit from the emergence of standard formats and tag sets, which could lead to sharable resources of larger size.', 'Clearly this poses a number of research challenges, though, such as the applicability of tag sets across different languages.', 'Nonetheless, the prospect of a network of annotated discourse resources seems particularly promising if not only a single annotation layer is used but a whole variety of them, so that a systematic search for correlations between them becomes possible, which in turn can lead to more

further, we added features to count the number of commas and conjunctions between a dependent verb and its candidate head.', 'Unlabeled accuracy for all verbs increases from 71% to 73% and for all conjunctions from 71% to 74%.', 'Unfortunately, accuracy for other word types decreases somewhat, resulting in no significant net accuracy change.', 'Nevertheless, this very preliminary experiment suggests that wider-range features may be useful in improving the recognition of overall sentence structure.', 'Another common verb attachment error is a switch between head and dependent verb in phrasal verb forms like dejan intrigar or qiero decir, possibly because the non-finite verb in these cases is often a main verb in training sentences.', 'We need to look more carefully at verb features that may be useful here, in particular features that distinguish finite and non-finite forms.', 'In doing this preliminary analysis, we noticed some inconsistencies in the reference dependency structures.', 'For example, in the test sentence Lo que decia Mae West de si misma podriamos decirlo tambi´en los hombres:..., decia’s head is given as decirlo, although the main verbs of relative clauses are normally dependent on what the relative modifies, in this case the article Lo.', 'A quick look at unlabeled attachment accuracies indicate that errors in Arabic parsing are the most common across all languages: prepositions (62%), conjunctions (69%) and to a lesser extent verbs (73%).', 'Similarly, for labeled accuracy, the hardest edges to label are for dependents of verbs, i.e., subjects, objects and adverbials.', 'Note the difference in error between the unlabeled parser and the edge labeler: the former makes mistakes on edges into prepositions, conjunctions and verbs, and the latter makes mistakes on edges into nouns (subject/objects).', 'Each stage by itself is relatively accurate (unlabeled accuracy is 79% and labeling accuracy3 is also 79%), but since there is very little overlap in the kinds of errors each makes, overall labeled accuracy drops to 67%.', 'This drop is not nearly as significant for other languages.', 'Another source of potential error is that the average sentence length of Arabic is much higher than other languages (around 37 words/sentence).', 'However, if we only look at performance for sentences of length less than 30, the labeled accuracy is still only 71%.', 'The fact that Arabic has only 1500 training instances might also be problematic.', 'For example if we train on 200, 400, 800 and the full training set, labeled accuracies are 54%, 60%, 62% and 67%.', 'Clearly adding more data is improving performance.', 'However, when compared to the performance of Slovene (1500 training instances) and Spanish (3300 instances), it appears that Arabic parsing is lagging.', 'We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al. (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) generalizes well to languages other than English.', 'In the future we plan to extend these models in two ways.', 'First, we plan on examining the performance difference between two-staged dependency parsing (as presented here) and joint parsing plus labeling.', 'It is our hypothesis that for languages with fine-grained label sets, joint parsing and labeling will improve performance.', 'Second, we plan on integrating any available morphological features in a more principled manner.', 'The current system simply includes all morphological bi-gram features.', 'It is our hope that a better morphological feature set will help with both unlabeled parsing and labeling for highly inflected languages.']",../data/papers/W06-2932.xml,"['../data/summaries/W06-2932_vardha.txt', '../data/summaries/W06-2932_sweta.txt', '../data/summaries/W06-2932_swastika.txt']","[['This paper talks about Multilingual Dependency Analysis with a Two-Stage Discriminative Parser.', 'Here we present a two-stage multilingual dependency parser and evaluate it on 13 diverse languages.', 'The first stage of our system creates an unlabeled parse y for an input sentence x.', 'The second stage takes the output parse y for sentence x and classifies each edge (i, j) E y with a particular label l (i,j).', 'Performance is measured through unlabeled accuracy, which is the percentage of words that modify the correct head in the dependency graph, and labeled accuracy, which is the percentage of words that modify the correct head and label the edge correctly in the graph.', 'The current system simply includes all morphological bi-gram features.', 'It is our hope that a better morphological feature set will help with both unlabeled parsing and labeling for highly inflected languages.'], ['In this paper the author aims at presenting a two-stage multilingual dependency parser and evaluates it on 13 diverse languages.', 'With the availability of resources such as the Penn WSJ Treebank, much of the focus in the parsing community had been on producing syntactic representations based on phrase-structure.', 'However, recently there has been a revived interest in parsing models that produce dependency graph representations of sentences, which model words and their arguments through directed edges.', 'Dependency graphs also encode much of the deep syntactic information needed for further processing.', 'In the future, the author plans to extend these models in two ways.', 'First, they plan on examining the performance difference between two-staged dependency parsing and joint parsing plus labelling.', 'Second, they plan on integrating any available morphological features in a more principled manner.', 'The current system simply includes all morphological bi-gram features.', 'It is the hope that a better morphological feature set will help with both unlabeled parsing and labelling for highly inflected languages.'], ['McDonald et all presented a two-stage multilingual pendency parser and evaluate it on 13 diverse languages.', 'The first stage based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira was augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages.', 'The second stage took the output from the first and labels all the edges in the dependency graph with appropriate syntactic categories using a globally trained sequence classifier over components of the graph.', 'They reported results on the CoNLL-X shared task data sets and presented an error analysis and presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of theirs generalized well to languages other than English.']]","['../data/annotation/W06-2932_vardha.json', '../data/annotation/W06-2932_sweta.json', '../data/annotation/W06-2932_swastika.json']"

manageable, partly because we assumed that it would be hard to find enough Finnish speakers for the manual evaluation.', 'The evaluation framework for the shared task is similar to the one used in last year’s shared task.', 'Training and testing is based on the Europarl corpus.', 'Figure 1 provides some statistics about this corpus.', 'To lower the barrier of entrance to the competition, we

set, we also collected 29 editorials from the Project Syndicate website2, which are published in all the four languages of the shared task.', 'We aligned the texts at a sentence level across all four languages, resulting in 1064 sentence per language.', 'For statistics on this test set, refer to Figure 1.', 'The out-of-domain test set differs from the Europarl data in various ways.', 'The text type are editorials instead of speech transcripts.', 'The domain is general politics, economics and science.', 'However, it is also mostly political content (even if not focused on the internal workings of the European Union) and opinion.', 'We received submissions from 14 groups from 11 institutions, as listed in Figure 2.', 'Most of these groups follow a phrase-based statistical approach to machine translation.', 'Microsoft’s approach uses dependency trees, others use hierarchical phrase models.', 'Systran submitted their commercial rule-based system that was not tuned to the Europarl corpus.', 'About half of the participants of last year’s shared task participated again.', 'The other half was replaced by other participants, so we ended up with roughly the same number.', 'Compared to last year’s shared task, the participants represent more long-term research efforts.', 'This may be the sign of a maturing research environment.', 'While building a machine translation system is a serious undertaking, in future we hope to attract more newcomers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry as low as possible.', 'For more on the participating systems, please refer to the respective system description in the proceedings of the workshop.', 'For the automatic evaluation, we used BLEU, since it is the most established metric in the field.', 'The BLEU metric, as all currently proposed automatic metrics, is occasionally suspected to be biased towards statistical systems, especially the phrase-based systems currently in use.', 'It rewards matches of n-gram sequences, but measures only at most indirectly overall grammatical coherence.', 'The BLEU score has been shown to correlate well with human judgement, when statistical machine translation systems are compared (Doddington, 2002; Przybocki, 2004; Li, 2005).', 'However, a recent study (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), pointed out that this correlation may not always be strong.', 'They demonstrated this with the comparison of statistical systems against (a) manually post-edited MT output, and (b) a rule-based commercial system.', 'The development of automatic scoring methods is an open field of research.', 'It was our hope that this competition, which included the manual and automatic evaluation of statistical systems and one rulebased commercial system, will give further insight into the relation between automatic and manual evaluation.', 'At the very least, we are creating a data resource (the manual annotations) that may the basis of future research in evaluation metrics.', 'We computed BLEU scores for each submission with a single reference translation.', 'For each sentence, we counted how many n-grams in the system output also occurred in the reference translation.', 'By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output, we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output, which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.', 'Because of this, we retokenized and lowercased submitted output with our own tokenizer, which was also used to prepare the training and test data.', 'Confidence Interval: Since BLEU scores are not computed on the sentence level, traditional methods to compute statistical significance and confidence intervals do not apply.', 'Hence, we use the bootstrap resampling method described by Koehn (2004).', 'Following this method, we repeatedly — say, 1000 times — sample sets of sentences from the output of each system, measure their BLEU score, and use these 1000 BLEU scores as basis for estimating a confidence interval.', 'When dropping the top and bottom 2.5% the remaining BLEU scores define the range of the confidence interval.', 'Pairwise comparison: We can use the same method to assess the statistical significance of one system outperforming another.', 'If two systems’ scores are close, this may simply be a random effect in the test data.', 'To check for this, we do pairwise bootstrap resampling: Again, we repeatedly sample sets of sentences, this time from both systems, and compare their BLEU scores on these sets.', 'If one system is better in 95% of the sample sets, we conclude that its higher BLEU score is statistically significantly better.', 'The bootstrap method has been critized by Riezler and Maxwell (2005) and Collins et al. (2005), as being too optimistic in deciding for statistical significant difference between systems.', 'We are therefore applying a different method, which has been used at the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.', 'We divide up each test set into blocks of 20 sentences (100 blocks for the in-domain test set, 53 blocks for the out-of-domain test set), check for each block, if one system has a higher BLEU score than the other, and then use the sign test.', 'The sign test checks, how likely a sample of better and worse BLEU scores would have been generated by two systems of equal performance.', 'Let say, if we find one system doing better on 20 of the blocks, and worse on 80 of the blocks, is it significantly worse?', 'We check, how likely only up to k = 20 better scores out of n = 100 would have been generated by two equal systems, using the binomial distribution: If p(0..k; n, p) < 0.05, or p(0..k; n, p) > 0.95 then we have a statistically significant difference between the systems.', 'While automatic measures are an invaluable tool for the day-to-day development of machine translation systems, they are only a imperfect substitute for human assessment of translation quality, or as the acronym BLEU puts it, a bilingual evaluation understudy.', 'Many human evaluation metrics have been proposed.', 'Also, the argument has been made that machine translation performance should be evaluated via task-based evaluation metrics, i.e. how much it assists performing a useful task, such as supporting human translators or aiding the analysis of texts.', 'The main disadvantage of manual evaluation is that it is time-consuming and thus too expensive to do frequently.', 'In this shared task, we were also confronted with this problem, and since we had no funding for paying human judgements, we asked participants in the evaluation to share the burden.', 'Participants and other volunteers contributed about 180 hours of labor in the manual evaluation.', 'We asked participants to each judge 200–300 sentences in terms of fluency and adequacy, the most commonly used manual evaluation metrics.', 'We settled on contrastive evaluations of 5 system outputs for a single test sentence.', 'See Figure 3 for a screenshot of the evaluation tool.', 'Presenting the output of several system allows the human judge to make more informed judgements, contrasting the quality of the different systems.', 'The judgements tend to be done more in form of a ranking of the different systems.', 'We assumed that such a contrastive assessment would be beneficial for an evaluation that essentially pits different systems against each other.', 'While we had up to 11 submissions for a translation direction, we did decide against presenting all 11 system outputs to the human judge.', 'Our initial experimentation with the evaluation tool showed that this is often too overwhelming.', 'Making the ten judgements (2 types for 5 systems) takes on average 2 minutes.', 'Typically, judges initially spent about 3 minutes per sentence, but then accelerate with experience.', 'Judges where excluded from assessing the quality of MT systems that were submitted by their institution.', 'Sentences and systems were randomly selected and randomly shuffled for presentation.', 'We collected around 300–400 judgements per judgement type (adequacy or fluency), per system, per language pair.', 'This is less than the 694 judgements 2004 DARPA/NIST evaluation, or the 532 judgements in the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.', 'This decreases the statistical significance of our results compared to those studies.', 'The number of judgements is additionally fragmented by our breakup of sentences into in-domain and out-of-domain.', 'The human judges were presented with the following definition of adequacy and fluency, but no additional instructions:', 'Judges varied in the average score they handed out.', 'The average fluency judgement per judge ranged from 2.33 to 3.67, the average adequacy judgement ranged from 2.56 to 4.13.', 'Since different judges judged different systems (recall that judges were excluded to judge system output from their own institution), we normalized the scores.', 'The normalized judgement per judge is the raw judgement plus (3 minus average raw judgement for this judge).', 'In words, the judgements are normalized, so that the average normalized judgement per judge is 3.', 'Another way to view the judgements is that they are less quality judgements of machine translation systems per se, but rankings of machine translation systems.', 'In fact, it is very difficult to maintain consistent standards, on what (say) an adequacy judgement of 3 means even for a specific language pair.', 'The way judgements are collected, human judges tend to use the scores to rank systems against each other.', 'If one system is perfect, another has slight flaws and the third more flaws, a judge is inclined to hand out judgements of 5, 4, and 3.', 'On the other hand, when all systems produce muddled output, but one is better, and one is worse, but not completely wrong, a judge is inclined to hand out judgements of 4, 3, and 2.', 'The judgement of 4 in the first case will go to a vastly better system output than in the second case.', 'We therefore also normalized judgements on a per-sentence basis.', 'The normalized judgement per sentence is the raw judgement plus (0 minus average raw judgement for this judge on this sentence).', 'Systems that generally do better than others will receive a positive average normalizedjudgement per sentence.', 'Systems that generally do worse than others will receive a negative one.', 'One may argue with these efforts on normalization, and ultimately their value should be assessed by assessing their impact on inter-annotator agreement.', 'Given the limited number of judgements we received, we did not try to evaluate this.', 'Confidence Interval: To estimate confidence intervals for the average mean scores for the systems, we use standard significance testing.', 'Given a set of n sentences, we can compute the sample mean x� and sample variance s2 of the individual sentence judgements xi: The extend of the confidence interval [x−d, x+df can be computed by d = 1.96 ·�n (6) Pairwise Comparison: As for the automatic evaluation metric, we want to be able to rank different systems against each other, for which we need assessments of statistical significance on the differences between a pair of systems.', 'Unfortunately, we have much less data to work with than with the automatic scores.', 'The way we cant distinction between system performance.', 'Automatic scores are computed on a larger tested than manual scores (3064 sentences vs. 300–400 sentences). collected manual judgements, we do not necessarily have the same sentence judged for both systems (judges evaluate 5 systems out of the 8–10 participating systems).', 'Still, for about good number of sentences, we do have this direct comparison, which allows us to apply the sign test, as described in Section 2.2.', 'The results of the manual and automatic evaluation of the participating system translations is detailed in the figures at the end of this paper.', 'The scores and confidence intervals are detailed first in the Figures 7–10 in table form (including ranks), and then in graphical form in Figures 11–16.', 'In the graphs, system scores are indicated by a point, the confidence intervals by shaded areas around the point.', 'In all figures, we present the per-sentence normalized judgements.', 'The normalization on a per-judge basis gave very similar ranking, only slightly less consistent with the ranking from the pairwise comparisons.', 'The confidence intervals are computed by bootstrap resampling for BLEU, and by standard significance testing for the manual scores, as described earlier in the paper.', 'Pairwise comparison is done using the sign test.', 'Often, two systems can not be distinguished with a confidence of over 95%, so there are ranked the same.', 'This actually happens quite frequently (more below), so that the rankings are broad estimates.', 'For instance: if 10 systems participate, and one system does better than 3 others, worse then 2, and is not significant different from the remaining 4, its rank is in the interval 3–7.', 'At first glance, we quickly recognize that many systems are scored very similar, both in terms of manual judgement and BLEU.', 'There may be occasionally a system clearly at the top or at the bottom, but most systems are so close that it is hard to distinguish them.', 'In Figure 4, we displayed the number of system comparisons, for which we concluded statistical significance.', 'For the automatic scoring method BLEU, we can distinguish three quarters of the systems.', 'While the Bootstrap method is slightly more sensitive, it is very much in line with the sign test on text blocks.', 'For the manual scoring, we can distinguish only half of the systems, both in terms of fluency and adequacy.', 'More judgements would have enabled us to make better distinctions, but it is not clear what the upper limit is.', 'We can check, what the consequences of less manual annotation of results would have been: With half the number of manual judgements, we can distinguish about 40% of the systems, 10% less.', 'The test set included 2000 sentences from the Europarl corpus, but also 1064 sentences out-ofdomain test data.', 'Since the inclusion of out-ofdomain test data was a very late decision, the participants were not informed of this.', 'So, this was a surprise element due to practical reasons, not malice.', 'All systems (except for Systran, which was not tuned to Europarl) did considerably worse on outof-domain training data.', 'This is demonstrated by average scores over all systems, in terms of BLEU, fluency and adequacy, as displayed in Figure 5.', 'The manual scores are averages over the raw unnormalized scores.', 'It is well know that language pairs such as EnglishGerman pose more challenges to machine translation systems than language pairs such as FrenchEnglish.', 'Different sentence structure and rich target language morphology are two reasons for this.', 'Again, we can compute average scores for all systems for the different language pairs (Figure 6).', 'The differences in difficulty are better reflected in the BLEU scores than in the raw un-normalized manual judgements.', 'The easiest language pair according to BLEU (English-French: 28.33) received worse manual scores than the hardest (English-German: 14.01).', 'This is because different judges focused on different language pairs.', 'Hence, the different averages of manual scores for the different language pairs reflect the behaviour of the judges, not the quality of the systems on different language pairs.', 'Given the closeness of most systems and the wide over-lapping confidence intervals it is hard to make strong statements about the correlation between human judgements and automatic scoring methods such as BLEU.', 'We confirm the finding by Callison-Burch et al. (2006) that the rule-based system of Systran is not adequately appreciated by BLEU.', 'In-domain Systran scores on this metric are lower than all statistical systems, even the ones that have much worse human scores.', 'Surprisingly, this effect is much less obvious for out-of-domain test data.', 'For instance, for out-ofdomain English-French, Systran has the best BLEU and manual scores.', 'Our suspicion is that BLEU is very sensitive to jargon, to selecting exactly the right words, and not synonyms that human judges may appreciate as equally good.', 'This is can not be the only explanation, since the discrepancy still holds, for instance, for out-of-domain French-English, where Systran receives among the best adequacy and fluency scores, but a worse BLEU score than all but one statistical system.', 'This data set of manual judgements should provide a fruitful resource for research on better automatic scoring methods.', 'So, who won the competition?', 'The best answer to this is: many research labs have very competitive systems whose performance is hard to tell apart.', 'This is not completely surprising, since all systems use very similar technology.', 'For some language pairs (such as GermanEnglish) system performance is more divergent than for others (such as English-French), at least as measured by BLEU.', 'The statistical systems seem to still lag behind the commercial rule-based competition when translating into morphological rich languages, as demonstrated by the results for English-German and English-French.', 'The predominate focus of building systems that translate into English has ignored so far the difficult issues of generating rich morphology which may not be determined solely by local context.', 'This is the first time that we organized a large-scale manual evaluation.', 'While we used the standard metrics of the community, the we way presented translations and prompted for assessment differed from other evaluation campaigns.', 'For instance, in the recent IWSLT evaluation, first fluency annotations were solicited (while withholding the source sentence), and then adequacy annotations.', 'Almost all annotators reported difficulties in maintaining a consistent standard for fluency and adequacy judgements, but nevertheless most did not explicitly move towards a ranking-based evaluation.', 'Almost all annotators expressed their preference to move to a ranking-based evaluation in the future.', 'A few pointed out that adequacy should be broken up into two criteria: (a) are all source words covered?', '(b) does the translation have the same meaning, including connotations?', 'Annotators suggested that long sentences are almost impossible to judge.', 'Since all long sentence translation are somewhat muddled, even a contrastive evaluation between systems was difficult.', 'A few annotators suggested to break up long sentences into clauses and evaluate these separately.', 'Not every annotator was fluent in both the source and the target language.', 'While it is essential to be fluent in the target language, it is not strictly necessary to know the source language, if a reference translation was given.', 'However, ince we extracted the test corpus automatically from web sources, the reference translation was not always accurate — due to sentence alignment errors, or because translators did not adhere to a strict sentence-by-sentence translation (say, using pronouns when referring to entities mentioned in the previous sentence).', 'Lack of correct reference translations was pointed out as a short-coming of our evaluation.', 'One annotator suggested that this was the case for as much as 10% of our test sentences.', 'Annotators argued for the importance of having correct and even multiple references.', 'It was also proposed to allow annotators to skip sentences that they are unable to judge.', 'We carried out an extensive manual and automatic evaluation of machine translation performance on European language pairs.', 'While many systems had similar performance, the results offer interesting insights, especially about the relative performance of statistical and rule-based

little time.', 'We use two common techniques, hash tables and sorted arrays, describing each before the model that uses the technique.', 'Hash tables are a common sparse mapping technique used by SRILM’s default and BerkeleyLM’s hashed variant.', 'Keys to the table are hashed, using for example Austin Appleby’s MurmurHash2, to integers evenly distributed over a large range.', 'This range is collapsed to a number of buckets, typically by taking the hash modulo the number of buckets.', 'Entries landing in the same bucket are said to collide.', 'Several methods exist to handle collisions; we use linear probing because it has less memory overhead when entries are small.', 'Linear probing places at most one entry in each bucket.', 'When a collision occurs, linear probing places the entry to be inserted in the next (higher index) empty bucket, wrapping around as necessary.', 'Therefore, a populated probing hash table consists of an array of buckets that contain either one entry or are empty.', 'Non-empty buckets contain an entry belonging to them or to a preceding bucket where a conflict occurred.', 'Searching a probing hash table consists of hashing the key, indexing the corresponding bucket, and scanning buckets until a matching key is found or an empty bucket is encountered, in which case the key does not exist in the table.', 'Linear probing hash tables must have more buckets than entries, or else an empty bucket will never be found.', 'The ratio of buckets to entries is controlled by space multiplier m > 1.', 'As the name implies, space is O(m) and linear in the number of entries.', 'The fraction of buckets that are empty is m−1 m , so average lookup time is O( m 1) and, crucially, constant in the number of entries.', 'When keys are longer than 64 bits, we conserve space by replacing the keys with their 64-bit hashes.', 'With a good hash function, collisions of the full 64bit hash are exceedingly rare: one in 266 billion queries for our baseline model will falsely find a key not present.', 'Collisions between two keys in the table can be identified at model building time.', 'Further, the special hash 0 suffices to flag empty buckets.', 'The PROBING data structure is a rather straightforward application of these hash tables to store Ngram language models.', 'Unigram lookup is dense so we use an array of probability and backoff values.',

implementation permits jumping to any n-gram of any length with a single lookup; this appears to be unique among language model implementations.', 'Sorted arrays store key-value pairs in an array sorted by key, incurring no space overhead.', 'SRILM’s compact variant, IRSTLM, MITLM, and BerkeleyLM’s sorted variant are all based on this technique.', 'Given a sorted array A, these other packages use binary search to find keys in O(log |A|) time.', 'We reduce this to O(log log |A|) time by evenly distributing keys over their range then using interpolation search4 (Perl et al., 1978).', 'Interpolation search formalizes the notion that one opens a dictionary near the end to find the word “zebra.” Initially, the algorithm knows the array begins at b +— 0 and ends at e +— |A|−1.', 'Given a key k, it estimates the position If the estimate is exact (A[pivot] = k), then the algorithm terminates succesfully.', 'If e < b then the key is not found.', 'Otherwise, the scope of the search problem shrinks recursively: if A[pivot] < k then this becomes the new lower bound: l +— pivot; if A[pivot] > k then u +— pivot.', 'Interpolation search is therefore a form of binary search with better estimates informed by the uniform key distribution.', 'If the key distribution’s range is also known (i.e. vocabulary identifiers range from 0 to the number of words), then interpolation search can use this information instead of reading A[0] and A[|A |− 1] to estimate pivots; this optimization alone led to a 24% speed improvement.', 'The improvement is due to the cost of bit-level reads and avoiding reads that may fall in different virtual memory pages.', 'Vocabulary lookup is a sorted array of 64-bit word hashes.', 'The index in this array is the vocabulary identifier.', 'This has the effect of randomly permuting vocabulary identifiers, meeting the requirements of interpolation search when vocabulary identifiers are used as keys.', 'While sorted arrays could be used to implement the same data structure as PROBING, effectively making m = 1, we abandoned this implementation because it is slower and larger than a trie implementation.', 'The trie data structure is commonly used for language modeling.', 'Our TRIE implements the popular reverse trie, in which the last word of an n-gram is looked up first, as do SRILM, IRSTLM’s inverted variant, and BerkeleyLM

default settings, 1.2% of n + 1-grams were missing their ngram suffix.', 'This causes a problem for reverse trie implementations, including SRILM itself, because it leaves n+1-grams without an n-gram node pointing to them.', 'We resolve this problem by inserting an entry with probability set to an otherwise-invalid value (−oc).', 'Queries detect the invalid probability, using the node only if it leads to a longer match.', 'By contrast, BerkeleyLM’s hash and compressed variants will return incorrect results based on an n −1-gram.', 'Floating point values may be stored in the trie exactly,

trie node."", 'Each trie node is individually allocated and full 64-bit pointers are used to find them, wasting memory.', 'The compact variant uses sorted arrays instead of hash tables within each node, saving some memory, but still stores full 64-bit pointers.', 'With some minor API changes, namely returning the length of the n-gram matched, it could also be faster—though this would be at the expense of an optimization we explain in Section 4.1.', 'The PROBING model was designed to improve upon SRILM by using linear probing hash tables (though not arranged in a trie), allocating memory all

aimed to reduce memory consumption at the expense of time.', 'Their default variant implements a forward trie, in which words are looked up in their natural left-to-right order.', 'However, their inverted variant implements a reverse trie using less CPU and the same amount of memory7.', 'Each trie node contains a sorted array of entries and they use binary search.', 'Compared with SRILM,

been publicly available and intergrated into Moses since October 2010.', 'Later, BerkeleyLM (Pauls and Klein, 2011) described ideas similar to ours.', 'Most similar is scrolling queries, wherein left-to-right queries that add one word at a time are optimized.', 'Both implementations employ a state object, opaque to the application, that carries information from one query to the next; we discuss both further in Section 4.2.', 'State is implemented in their scrolling variant, which is a trie annotated with forward and backward pointers.', 'The hash variant is a reverse trie with hash tables, a more memory-efficient version of SRILM’s default.', 'While the paper mentioned a sorted variant, code was never released.', 'The compressed variant uses block compression and is rather slow

'For all variants, we found that BerkeleyLM always rounds the floating-point mantissa to 12 bits then stores indices to unique rounded floats.', 'The 1-bit sign is almost always negative and the 8-bit exponent is not fully used on the range of values, so in practice this corresponds to quantization ranging from 17 to 20 total bits.', 'Lossy compressed models RandLM (Talbot and Osborne, 2007) and Sheffield (Guthrie and Hepple, 2010) offer better memory consumption at the expense of CPU and accuracy.', 'These enable much larger models in memory, compensating for lost accuracy.', 'Typical data

assist in choosing between hypotheses.', 'Dynamic programming efficiently scores many hypotheses by exploiting the fact that an N-gram language model conditions on at most N − 1 preceding words.', 'We call these N − 1 words state.', 'When two partial hypotheses have equal state (including that of other features), they can be recombined and thereafter efficiently handled as a single packed

techniques.', 'The first shows how constituent features and context do not help in deciding which parser to trust.', 'We then show that the combining techniques presented above give better parsing accuracy than any of the individual parsers.', 'Finally we show the combining techniques degrade very little when a poor parser is added to the set.', 'It is possible one could produce better models

more accurate at predicting noun phrases than the other parsers.', 'None of the models we have presented utilize features associated with a particular constituent (i.e. the label, span, parent label,

cannot prove there are no such useful features on which one should condition trust, we can give some insight into why the features we explored offered no gain.', 'Because we are working with only three parsers, the only situation in which context will help us is when it can indicate we should choose to believe a single parser that disagrees with the majority hypothesis instead of the majority hypothesis itself.', 'This is the only important case, because otherwise the simple majority combining technique would pick the correct constituent.', 'One side of the decision making process is when we choose to believe a constituent should be in the parse, even though only one parser suggests it.', 'We call such a constituent an isolated constituent.', 'If we were working with more than three parsers we could investigate minority constituents, those constituents that are suggested by at least one parser, but which the majority of the parsers do not suggest.', 'Adding the isolated constituents to our hypothesis parse could increase our expected recall, but in the cases we investigated it would invariably hurt our precision more than we would gain on recall.', 'Consider for a set of constituents the isolated constituent precision parser metric, the portion of isolated constituents that are correctly hypothesized.', ""When this metric is less than 0.5, we expect to incur more errors' than we will remove by adding those constituents to the parse."", 'We show the results of three of the experiments we conducted to measure isolated constituent precision under various

larger than 0.5 only in those partitions that contain very few samples.', 'From this we see that a finer-grained model for parser combination, at least for the features we have examined, will not give us any additional power.', 'The results in Table 2 were achieved on the development set.', 'The first two rows of the table are baselines.', 'The first row represents the average accuracy of the three

the accuracy that can be achieved on this set in the parser switching framework.', 'It is the performance we could achieve if an omniscient observer told us which parser to pick for each of the

interpret this is that less than 5% of the correct constituents are missing from the hypotheses generated by the union of the three parsers.', 'The maximum precision oracle is an upper bound on the possible gain we can achieve by parse hybridization.', 'We do not show the numbers for the Bayes models in Table 2 because the parameters involved were established using this set.', 'The precision and

systems were run on data that was not seen during their development.', 'The difference in precision between similarity and Bayes switching techniques is significant, but the difference in recall is not.', 'This is the first set that gives us a fair evaluation of the Bayes models, and the Bayes switching model performs significantly better than its non-parametric counterpart.', 'The constituent voting and naïve Bayes techniques are equivalent because the parameters learned in the training set did not sufficiently discriminate between the three parsers.', 'Table 4 shows how much the Bayes switching technique uses each of the parsers on the test set.', 'Parser 3, the most accurate parser, was chosen 71% of the time, and Parser 1, the least accurate parser was chosen 16% of the time.', 'Ties are rare in Bayes switching because the models are fine-grained — many estimated probabilities are involved in each decision.', 'In the interest of testing the robustness of these combining techniques, we added a fourth, simple nonlexicalized PCFG parser.', 'The PCFG was trained from the same sections of the Penn Treebank as the other three parsers.', 'It was then tested on section 22 of the Treebank in conjunction with the other parsers.', 'The results of this experiment can be seen in Table 5.', 'The entries in this table can be compared with those of Table 3 to see how the performance of the combining techniques degrades in the presence of an inferior parser.', 'As seen by the drop in average individual parser performance baseline, the introduced parser does not perform

Coreference tasks entailed Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) annotation of texts and were being conducted for the first time.', 'The other two tasks, Template Element and Scenario Template, were information extraction tasks that followed on from the MUC evaluations conducted in previous years.', 'The evolution and design of the MUC6 evaluation are discussed in the paper by Grishman and Sundheim in this volume.', 'All except the Scenario Template task are defined independently of any particular domain.', 'This paper surveys the results of the evaluation on each task and, to a more limited extent, across tasks.', 'Discussion of the results for each task is organized generally under the following topics: \x95 Results on task as whole; \x95 Results on some aspects of task; \x95 Performance on ""walkthrough article.""', 'The walkthrough article is an article selected from the test set.', ""Participants were asked to analyze their system's performance on that article and comment on it in their presentations and papers."", 'EVALUATION TASKS A basic characterization of the challenge presented by each evaluation task is as follows: \x95 Named Entity (NE) --Insert SGML tags into the text to mark each string that represents a person, organization, or location name, or a date or time stamp, or a currency or percentage figure.', '\x95 Coreference (CO) --Insert SGML tags into the text to link strings that represent coreferring noun phrases.', '\x95 Template Element (TE) --Extract basic information related to organization and person entities, drawing evidence from anywhere in the text.', '\x95 Scenario Template (ST) --Drawing evidence from anywhere in the text, extract prespecified event information, and relate the event information to the particular organization and person entities involved in the event.', 'The two SGML-based tasks required innovations to tie system-internal data structures to the original text so that the annotations could be inserted by the system without altering the original text in any other way.', 'This capability has other useful applications as well, e.g., it enables text highlighting in a browser.', 'It also facilitates information extraction, since some of the information in the extraction templates is in the form of literal text strings, which some systems have in the past had difficulty reproducing in their output.', 'The inclusion of four different tasks in the evaluation implicitly encouraged sites to design general-purpose architectures that allow the production of a variety of types of output from a single internal representation in order to allow use of the full range of analysis techniques for all tasks.', 'Even the simplest of the tasks, Named Entity, occasionally requires in-depth processing, e.g., to determine whether ""60 pounds"" is an expression of weight or of monetary value.', 'Nearly half the sites chose to participate in all four tasks, and all but one site participated in at least one SGML task and one extraction task.', 'The variety of tasks designed for MUC6 reflects the interests of both participants and sponsors in assessing and furthering research that can satisfy some urgent text processing needs in the very near term and can lead to solutions to more challenging text understanding problems in the longer term.', 'Identification of certain common types of names, which constitutes a large portion of the Named Entity task and a critical portion of the Template Element task, has proven to be largely a solved problem.', 'Recognition of alternative ways of identifying an entity constitutes a large portion of the Coreference task and another critical portion of the Template Element task and has been shown to represent only a modest challenge when the referents are names or pronouns.', 'The mix of challenges that the Scenario Template task represents has been shown to yield levels of performance that are smilar to those achieved in previous MUCs, but this time with a much shorter time required for porting.', 'Documentation of each of the tasks and summary scores for all systems evaluated can be found in the MUC6 proceedings [1].', 'CORPUS Testing was conducted using Wall Street Journal texts provided by the Linguistic Data Consortium.', 'The articles used in the evaluation were drawn from a corpus of approximately 58,000 articles spanning the period of January 1993 through June 1994.', 'This period comprised the ""evaluation epoch.""', 'As a condition for participation in the evaluation, the sites agreed not to seek out and exploit Wall Street Journal articles from that epoch once the training phase of the evaluation had begun, i.e., once the scenario for the Scenario Template task had been disclosed to the participants.', 'The training set and test set each consisted of 100 articles and were drawn from the corpus using a text retrieval system called Managing Gigabytes, whose retrieval engine is based on a context-vector model, producing a ranked list of hits according to degree of match with a keyword search query.', 'It can also be used to do unranked, Boolean retrievals.', 'The Boolean retrieval method was used in the initial probing of the corpus to identify candidates for the Scenario Template task, because the Boolean retrieval is relatively fast, and the unranked results are easy to scan to get a feel for the variety of nonrelevant as well as relevant documents that match all or some of the query terms.', 'Once the scenario had been identified, the ranked retrieval method was used, and the ranked list was sampled at different points to collect approximately 200 relevant and 200 nonrelevant articles, representing a variety of article types (feature articles, brief notices, editorials, etc.).', 'From those candidate articles, the training and test sets were selected blindly, with later checks and corrections for imbalances in the relevant/nonrelevant categories and in article types.', 'From the 100 test articles, a subset of 30 articles (some relevant to the Scenario Template task, others not) was selected for use as the test set for the Named Entity and Coreference tasks.', 'The selection was again done blindly, with later checks to ensure that the set was fairly representative in terms of article length and type.', 'Note that although Named Entity, Coreference and Template Element are defined as domain-independent tasks, the articles that were used for MUC6 testing were selected using domain-dependent criteria pertinent to the Scenario Template task.', 'The manually filled templates were created with the aid of Tabula Rasa, a software tool developed for the Tipster Text Program by New Mexico State University Computing Research Laboratory.', 'NAMED ENTITY The Named Entity (NE) task requires insertion of SGML tags into the text stream.', 'The tag elements are ENAMEX (for entity names, comprising organizations, persons, and locations), TIMEX (for temporal expressions, namely direct mentions of dates and times), and NUMEX (for number expressions, consisting only of direct mentions of currency values and percentages).', 'A TYPE attribute accompanies each tag element and identifies the subtype of each tagged string: for ENAMEX, the TYPE value can be ORGANIZATION, PERSON, or LOCATION; for TIMEX, the TYPE value can be DATE or TIME; and for NUMEX, the TYPE value can be MONEY or PERCENT.', 'Text strings that are to be annotated are termed markables.', 'As indicated above, markables include names of organizations, persons, and locations, and direct mentions of dates, times, currency values and percentages.', 'Non-markables include names of products and other miscellaneous names (""Macintosh,"" ""Wall Street Journal"" (in reference to the periodical as a physical object), ""Dow Jones Industrial Average""); names of groups of people and miscellaneous usages of person names (""Republicans,"" ""GrammRudman,"" ""Alzheimer[\'s]""); addresses and adjectival forms of location names (""53140 Gatchell Rd.,"" ""American""); indirect and vague mentions of dates and times (""a few minutes after the hour,"" ""thirty days before the end of the year""); and miscellaneous uses of numbers, including some that are similar to currency or percentage expressions (""[Fees] 1 3/4,"" ""12 points,"" ""1.5 times"").', 'The evaluation metrics used for NE are essentially the same as those used for the two template-filling tasks, Template Element and Scenario Template.', 'The following breakdowns of overall scores on NE are computed: \x95 by slot, i.e., for performance across tag elements, across TYPE attributes, and across tag strings; \x95 by subcategorization, i.e., for performance on each TYPE attribute separately; \x95 by document section, i.e., for performance on distinct subparts of the article, as identified by the SGML tags contained in the original text: <HL> (""headline""), <DD> (""document date""), <DATELINE>, and <TXT> (the body of the article).', 'NE Results Overall Fifteen sites participated in the NE evaluation, including two that submitted two system configurations for testing and one that submitted four, for a total of 20 systems.', 'As shown in table 1, performance on the NE task overall was over 90% on the F-measure for half of the systems tested, which includes systems from seven different sites.', 'On the basis of the results of the dry run, in which two of the nine systems scored over 90%, we were not surprised to find official scores that were similarly high, but it was not expected that so many systems would enter the formal evaluation and perform so well.', 'It was also unexpected that one of the systems would match human performance on the task.', 'Human performance was measured by comparing the 30 draft answer keys produced by the annotator at NRaD with those produced by the annotator at SAIC.', 'This test measures the amount of variability between the annotators.', 'When the outputs are scored in ""key-to-response"" mode, as though one annotator\'s output represented the ""key"" and the other the ""response,"" the humans achieved an overall F-measure of 96.68 and a corresponding error per response fill (ERR) score of 6%.', 'The top-scoring system, the baseline configuration of the SRA system, achieved an F-measure of 96.42 and a corresponding error score of 5%.', 'In considering the significance of these results from a general standpoint, the following facts about the test set need to be remembered: 96.42 95.66 94.92 94.00 93.65 93.33 92.88 92.74 92.61 91.20 90.84 89.06 88.19 85.82 85.73 84.95 5 7 8 10 10 11 10 12 12 13 14 18 19 20 23 22 96 95 93 92 94 92 94 92 89 91 91 84 86 85 80 82 97 96 96 96 93 95 92 93 96 91 91 94

just one style of writing ""the Chrysler division"" (currently, only ""Chrysler"" (journalistic) and has a basic basic toward financial news and a specific bias toward the topic of the Scenario Template task.', '\x95 It was very small (only 30 articles).', 'There were no markable time expressions in the test set, and there were only a few markable percentage expressions.', 'The results should also be qualified by saying that they reflect performance on data that makes accurate usage of upper and lower case distinctions.', ""What would performance be on data where case provided no (reliable) clues and for languages where case doesn't distinguish names?"", 'SRA ran an experiment on an uppercase version of the test set that showed 85% recall and 89% precision overall, with identification of organization names presenting the greatest problem.', 'That result represents nearly a 10-point decrease on the F-measure from their official baseline.', ""The case-insensitive results would be slightly better if the task guidelines themselves didn't depend on case distinctions in certain situations, as when identifying the right boundary for the organization name span in a string such as would be tagged)."", 'NE Results on Some Aspects of Task Figures 1 and 2 show the sample size for the various tag elements and TYPE values.', 'Note that nearly 80% of the tags were ENAMEX and that almost half of those were subcategofized as organization names.', 'As indicated in table 2, all systems performed better on identifying person names than on identifying organization or location names, and all but a few systems performed better on location names than on organization names.', 'Organization names are varied in their form, consisting of proper nouns, general vocabulary, or a mixture of the two.', 'They can also be quite long and complex and can even have internal punctuation such as a commas or an ampersand.', 'Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish them from names of other types, especially from person names.', 'Common organization names, first names of people, and location names can be handled by recourse to list lookup, although there are drawbacks: some names may be on more than one list, the lists will not be complete and may not match the name as it is realized in the text (e.g., may not cover the needed abbreviated form of an organization name, may not cover the complete person name), etc..', 'The difference that recourse to lists can make in performance is seen by comparing two runs made by SRA.', 'The experimental configuration resulted in a three point decrease in recall and one point decrease in precision, compared to the performance of the baseline system configuration.', 'The changes occurred only in performance on identifying organizations.', 'BBN conducted a comparative test in which the experimental configuration used a larger lexicon than the baseline configuration, but the exact nature of the difference is not known and the performance differences are very small.', 'As with the SRA experiment, the only differences in performance between the two BBN configurations are with the organization type.', ""The University of Durham reported that they had intended to use gazetteer and company name lists, but didn't, because they found that the lists did not have much effect on their system's performance."", 'The error scores for persons, dates, and monetary expressions was less than or equal to 10% for the large majority of systems.', 'Several systems posted scores under 10% error for locations, but none was able to do so for oganizations.', 'For percentages, about half the systems had 0% error, which reflects the simplicity of that particular subtask.', 'Note that the number of instances of percentages in the test set is so small that a single mistake could result in an error of 6%.', 'Slot-level performance on ENAMEX follows a different pattern for most systems from slot-level performance on NUMEX and TIMEX.', 'The general pattern is for systems to have done better on the TEXT slot than on the TYPE slot for ENAMEX tags and for systems to have done better on the TYPE slot than on the TEXT slot for NUMEX and TIMEX tags.', 'Errors on the TEXT slot are errors in finding the right span for the tagged string, and this can be a problem for all three subcategories of tag.', 'The TYPE slot, however, is a more difficult slot for ENAMEX than for the other subcategories.', 'It involves a three-way distinction for ENAMEX and only a two-way distinction for NUMEX and TIMEX, and it offers the possibility of confusing names of one type with names of another, especially the possibility of confusing organization names with person names.', 'Looking at the document section scores in table 3, we see that the error score on the body of the text was much lower than on the headline for all but a few systems.', 'There was just one system that posted a higher error score on the body than on the headline, the baseline NMSU CRL configuration, and the difference in scores is largely due to the fact that the system overgenerated to a greater extent on the body than on the headline.', 'Its basic strategy for 96.42 0 95.66 0 0 7 7 94.92 0 0 8 8 94.00 0 0 20 9 93.65 0 2 16 10 93.33 0 4 38 9 92.88 0 0 18 10 92.74 0 0 22 11 92.61 100 0 18 9 91.20 0 0 30 13 90.84 3 11 19 14 89.06 3 4 28 18 88.19 0 0 22 20

in the headline as a name only if the system had found it in the body of the text or if the system had predicted the name based on truncation of names found in the body of the text.', 'Most, if not all, the systems that were evaluated on the NE task adopted the basic strategy of processing the headline after processing the body of the text.', 'The interannotator variability test provides reference points indicating human performance on the different aspects of the NE task.', 'The document section results show 0% error on Document Date and Dateline, 7% error on Headline, and 6% error on Text.', 'The subcategory error scores were 6% on Organization, 1% on Person, and 4% on Location, 8% on Date, and 0% on Money and Percent.', 'These results show that human variability on this task patterns in a way that is similar to the performance of most of the systems in all respects except perhaps one: the greatest source of difficulty for the humans was on identifying dates.', 'Analysis of the results shows that some Date errors were a result of simple oversight (e.g., ""fiscal 1994"") and others were a consequence of forgetting or misinterpreting the task guidelines with respect to determining the maximal span of the date expression (e.g., tagging ""fiscal 1993\'s second quarter"" and ""Aug. 1"" separately, rather than tagging ""fiscal 1993\'s second quarter, ended Aug. 1"" as a single expression in accordance with the task guidelines).', 'NE Results on ""Walkthrough Article"" In the answer key for the walkthrough article there are 69 ENAMEX tags (including a few optional ones), six TIMEX tags and six NUMEX tags.', 'Interannotator scoring showed that one annotator missed tagging one instance of ""Coke"" as an (optional) organization, and the other annotator missed one date expression (""September"").', 'Common mistakes made by the systems included missing the date expression, ""the 21st century,"" and spuriously identifying ""60 pounds"" (which appeared in the context, ""Mr. Dooner, who recently lost 60 pounds over three-and-a-half months ....', '"") as a monetary value rather than ignoring it as a weight.', 'In addition, a number of errors identifying entity names were made; some of those errors also showed up as errors on the Template Element task and are described in a later section of this paper.', 'COREFERENCE The task as defined for MUC6 was restricted to noun phrases (NPs) and was intended to be limited to phenomena that were relatively noncontroversial and easy to describe.', 'The variety of high-frequency phenomena covered by the task is partially represented in the following hypothetical example, where all bracketed text segments are considered coreferential: 428 [Motor Vehicles International Corp.] announced a major management shakeup ....', '[MVI] said the chief executive officer has resigned ....', '[The Big 10 auto maker] is attempting to regain market share ....', '[It] will announce significant losses for the fourth quarter ....', 'A [company] spokesman said [they] are moving [their] operations to Mexico in a cost-saving effort ....', '[MVI, [the first company to announce such a move since the passage of the new international trade agreement],] is facing increasing demands from unionized workers ....', '[Motor Vehicles International] is [the biggest American auto exporter to Latin America].', 'The example passage covers a broad spectrum of the phenomena included in the task.', 'At one end of the spectrum are the proper names and aliases, which are inherently definite and whose referent may appear anywhere in the text.', 'In the middle of the spectrum are definite descriptions and pronouns whose choice of referent is constrained by such factors as structural relations and discourse focus.', 'On the periphery of the central phenomena are markables whose status as coreferring expressions is determined by syntax, such as predicate nominals (""Motor Vehicles International is the biggest American auto exporter to Latin America"") and 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 10 20 30 appositives (""MVI, the first company to announce such a move since the passage of the new international trade agreement"").', 'At the far end of the spectrum are bare common nouns, such as the prenominal ""company"" in the example, whose status as a referring expression may be questionable.', 'An algorithm developed by the MITRE Corporation for MUC6 was implemented by SAIC and used for scoring the task.', 'The algorithm compares the equivalence classes defined by the coreference links in the manually-generated answer key and the system-generated response.', 'The equivalence classes are the models of the identity equivalence coreference relation.', 'Using a simple counting scheme, the algorithm obtains recall and precision scores by determining the minimal perturbations required to align the equivalence classes in the key and response.', 'No metrics other than recall and precision were defined for this task, and no statistical significance testing was performed on the scores.', 'CO Results Overall In all, seven sites participated in the MUC6 coreference evaluation.', 'Most systems achieved approximately the same levels of performance: five of the seven systems were in the 51%-63% recall O0 \x95 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Recall Figure 3.', 'Overall recall and precision on the CO task 2 2 Key to recall and precision scores: UDurham 36R/44P, UManitoba 63R/63P, UMass 44R/51P, NYU 53R/62P, UPenn 55R/63P, USheffield 51R/71P, SRI 59R/72P..', 'range and 62%-72% precision range.', 'About half the systems focused only on individual coreference, which has direct relevance to the other MUC6 evaluation tasks.', 'A few of the evaluation sites reported that good name/alias recognition alone would buy a system a lot of recall and precision points on this task, perhaps about 30% recall (since proper names constituted a large minority of the annotations) and 90% precision.', 'The precision figure is supported by evidence from the NE evaluation.', 'In that evaluation, a number of systems scored over 90% on the named entity recall and precision metrics, providing a sound basis for good performance on the coreference task for individual entities.', 'In the middle of the effort of preparing the test data for the formal evaluation, an interannotator variability test was conducted.', 'The two versions of the independently prepared, manual annotations of 17 articles were scored against each other using the scoring program in the normal ""key to response"" scoring mode.', 'The amount of agreement between the two annotators was found to be 80% recall and 82% precision.', 'There was a large number of factors that contributed to the 20% disagreement, including overlooking coreferential NPs, using different interpretations of vague portions of the guidelines, and making different subjective decisions when the text of an article was ambiguous, sloppy, etc..', 'Most human errors pertained to definite descriptions and bare nominals, not to names and pronouns.', 'CO Results on Some Aspects of Task and on ""Walkthrough Article"" To keep the annotation of the evaluation data fairly simple, the MUC6 planning committee decided not to design the notation to subcategorize linkages and markables in any way.', 'Two useful attributes for the equivalence class as a whole would be one to distinguish individual coreference from type coreference and one to identify the general semantic type of the class (organization, person, location, time, currency, etc.).', 'For each NP in the equivalence class, it would be useful to identify its grammatical type (proper noun phrase, definite common noun phrase, bare singular common noun phrase, personal pronoun, etc.).', 'The decision to minimize the annotation effort makes it difficult to do detailed quantitative analysis of the results.', ""An analysis by the participating sites of their system's performance on the walkthrough article provides some insight into performance on aspects of the coreference task that were dominant in that article."", 'The article contains about 1000 words and approximately 130 coreference links, of which all but about a dozen are references to individual persons or individual organizations.', 'Approximately 50 of the anaphors are personal pronouns, including reflexives and possessives, and 58 of the markables (anaphors and antecedents) are proper names, including aliases.', 'The percentage of personal pronouns is relatively high (38%), compared to the test set overall (24%), as is the percentage of proper names (40% on this text versus an estimate of 30% overall).', 'Performance on this particular article for some systems was higher than performance on the test set overall, reaching as high as 77% recall and 79% precision.', 'These scores indicate that pronoun resolution techniques as well as proper noun matching techniques are good, compared to the techniques required to determine references involving common noun phrases.', 'For common noun phrases, the systems were not required to include the entire NP in the response; the response could minimally contain only the head noun.', 'Despite this flexibility in the expected contents of the response, the systems nonetheless had to implicitly recognize the full NP, since to be considered coreferential, the head and its modifiers all had to be consistent with another markable.', 'TEMPLATE ELEMENT The Template Element (TE) task requires extraction of certain general types of information about entities and merging of the information about any given entity before presentation in the form of a template (or ""object"").', 'For MUC6 the entities that were to be extracted were limited to organizations and persons) The ORGANIZATION object contains attributes (""slots"") for the string representing the organization name (ORG NAME), for strings representing any abbreviated versions of the name (ORG_ALIAS), for a string that describes the particular organization (ORG_DESCRIPTOR), for a subcategory of the type of organization (ORG_TYPE, whose permissible values are GOVERNMENT, COMPANY, and OTHER), and for canonical forms of the specific and general location of the organization (ORG LOCALE and ORG_COUNTRY).', 'The PERSON object contains

evaluation are the same as those required for the Scenario Template task.', 'slots only for the string representing the person name (PER_NAME), for strings representing any abbreviated versions of the name (PERALIAS), and for strings representing a very limited range of titles (PER_TITLE).', 'The task places heavy emphasis on recognizing proper noun phrases, as in the NE task, since all slots except ORG_DESCRIPTOR and PERTITLE expect proper names as slot fillers (in string or canonical form, depending on the slot.', 'However, the organization portion of the TE task is not limited to recognizing the referential identity between full and shortened names; it requires the use of text analysis techniques at all levels of text structure to associate the descriptive and locative information with the appropriate entity.', 'Analysis of complex NP structures, such as appositional structures and postposed modifier adjuncts, is needed in order to relate the locale and descriptor to the name in ""Creative Artists Agency, the big Hollywood talent agency"" and in ""Creative Artists Agency, a big talent agency based in Hollywood.""', 'Analysis of sentence structures to identify grammatical relations such as predicate nominals is needed in order to relate those same pieces of information in ""Creative Artists Agency is a big talent agency based in Hollywood.""', 'Analysis of discourse structure is needed in order to identify long-distance relationships.', 'The answer key for the TE task contains one object for each specific organization and person mentioned in the text.', 'For generation of a PERSON object, the text must provide the name of the person (full name or part of a name).', 'For generation of an ORGANIZATION object, the text must provide either the name (full or part) or a descriptor of the organization.', 'Since the generation of these objects is independent of the relevance criteria imposed by the Scenario Template (ST) task, there are many more ORGANIZATION and PERSON objects in the TE key than in the ST key.', 'For the formal evaluation, there were 606 ORGANIZATION and 496 PERSON objects in the TE key, versus 120 ORGANIZATION and 137 PERSON objects in the ST key.', 'The same set of articles was used for TE as for ST; therefore, the content of the articles is oriented toward the terms and subject matter covered by the ST task, which concerns changes in corporate management.', '4 One effect of this bias is simply the number of entities mentioned in the articles: for the 4 The method used for selecting the articles for the test set is described at the beginning of this article..', 'test set used for the MUC6 dry run, which was based on a scenario concerning labor union contract negotiations, there were only about half as many organizations and persons mentioned as there were in the test set used for the formal run.', 'TE Results Overall Twelve systems -- from eleven sites, including one that submitted two system configurations for testing--were tested on the TE task.', 'All but two of the systems posted F-measure scores in the 7080% range, and four of the systems were able to achieve recall in the 7080% range while maintaining precision in the 8090% range, as shown in the figure 4.', 'Human performance was measured in terms of variability between the outputs produced by the two NRaD and SAIC evaluators for 30 of the articles in the test set (the same 30 articles that were used for NE and CO testing).', 'Using the scoring method in which one annotator\'s draft key serves as the ""key"" and the other annotator\'s draft key serves as the ""response,"" the overall consistency score was 93.14 on the F-measure, with 93% recall and 93% precision.', 'TE Results on Some Aspects of Task Given the more varied extraction requirements for the ORGANIZATION object, it is not surprising that performance on that portion of the TE task was not as good as on the PERSON object 5, as is clear in figure 5.', 'Figure 6 indicates the relative amount of error contributed by each of the slots in the ORGANIZATION object.', 'It is evident that the more linguistic processing necessary to fill a slot, the harder the slot is to fill correctly.', 'The ORG_COUNTRY slot is a special case in a way, since it is required to be filled when the ORG_LOCALE slot is filled.', '(The reverse is not the case, i.e., ORG_COUNTRY may be filled even if ORG_LOCALE is not, but this situation is relatively rare.)', 'Since a missing or spurious ORG_LOCALE is likely to incur the same error in ORG_COUNTRY, the error scores for the two slots are understandably similar.', '5 The highest score for the PERSON object, 95% recall and 95% precision, is close to the highest score on the NE subcategorization for person,

find to account for the relatively low performance on the ORG_DESCRIPTOR slot?', 'One reason for low performance is that an organization may be identified in a text solely by a descriptor, i.e., without a fill for the ORG_NAME slot and therefore without the usual local clues that the NP is in fact a relevant descriptor.', 'It is, of course, also possible that a text may identify an organization solely by name.', 'Both possibilities present increased opportunities for systems to undergenerate or overgenerate.', 'Also, the descriptor is not always close to the name, and some discourse processing may be requ~ed in order to identify it --this is likely to increase the opportunity for systems to miss the information.', 'A third significant reason is that the response fill had to match the key fill exactly in order to be counted correct; there was no allowance made in the scoring software for assigning full or partial credit if the response fill only partially matched the key fill.', 'It should be noted that human performance on this task was also relatively low, but it is unclear whether the degree of disagreement can be accounted for primarily by the reasons given above or whether the disagreement is attributable to the fact that the guidelines for that slot had not been finalized at the time when the annotators created their version of the keys.', 'TE Results on ""Walkthrough Article"" TE performance of all systems on the walkthrough article was not as good as performance on the test set as a whole, but the difference is small for about half the

'There are cases of organization names misidentified as person names, there is a case of a location name misidentified as an organization name, and there are cases of nonrelevant entity types

the wrong type of object.', 'Examples of each of these types of error appear below, along with the number of systems that committed the error.', '(An experimental configuration of the SRA system
