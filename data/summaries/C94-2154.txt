In this paper, the authors try to show the kind of constraints expressible by appropriateness conditions cane be implemented in a practical system employing typed features structures and unification as the primary operation on feature structures.
Being able to express the class of constraints by appropriateness conditions corresponding closely to the class of constraints that can be efficiently pre-compiled is taken as a justification for appropriateness formalisms.
