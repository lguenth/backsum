The authors’ aim is to consider the problem of question focused sentence retrieval from complex news
articles describing multi-event stories published over time.
Annotators generated a list of questions
central to understanding each story in our corpus.
Recent work has motivated the need for systems
that support “Information Synthesis” tasks, in which a user seeks a global understanding of a topic or
story.
The specific problem they consider differs from the classic task of PR for a Q&A system in
interesting ways, due to the time-sensitive nature of the stories in our corpus.
They aim to develop a
method for sentence retrieval that goes beyond finding sentences that are similar to a single query.
To
this end, they propose to use a stochastic, graph-based method.
To evaluate their sentence retrieval
mechanism, they produced extract files, which contain a list of sentence deemed to be relevant to the
question, for the system and from human judgment.
During the task, they have shown that over a
large set of unaltered questions written by their annotators, LexRank can, on average, outperform the
baseline system, particularly in terms of TRDR scores.
