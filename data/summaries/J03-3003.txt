In this paper the aim of the model is detecting and predicting dialogue acts based on lexical,
collocation, and prosodic cues, as well as on the discourse coherence of the dialogue act sequence.
The first level of analysis involves the identification of dialogue acts. DA represents the meaning of
an utterance at the level of illocutionary force. The DAs tagset classifies utterances according to a
combination of pragmatic, semantic, and syntactic criteria. Another important role of DA information
could be feedback to lower-level processing. The goal of this article is twofold: On the one hand, we
aim to present a comprehensive framework for modelling and automatic classification of DAs,
founded on well-known statistical methods. Second, we present results obtained with this approach on
a large, widely available corpus of spontaneous conversational speech. The domain we chose to
model is the Switchboard corpus of human-human conversational telephone speech distributed by the
Linguistic Data Consortium. Automatic segmentation of spontaneous speech is an open research
problem in its own right. Finally, the author developed a principled way of incorporating DA
modelling into the probability model of a continuous speech recognizer, by constraining word
hypotheses using the discourse context. However, the approach gives only a small reduction in word
error on our corpus, which can be attributed to a preponderance of a single dialogue act type.
