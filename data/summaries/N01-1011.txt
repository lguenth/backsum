This paper presents a corpus-based approach to
word sense disambiguation where a decision tree assigns
a sense to an ambiguous word based on the
bigrams that occur nearby.for this purpose the
sense inventory of word sense has already been determined.
This paper describes an approach where a deci-
sion tree is learned from some number of sentences
where each instance of an ambiguous word has been
manually annotated with a sense-tag that denotes
the most appropriate sense for that context and for Building a Feature Set of Bigrams;
two alternatives, the power divergence family
and the Dice Coefficient were explored.
this study utilizes the training and test
data from the 1998 SENSEVAL evaluation of word
sense disambiguation systems.
The results of this approach
are compared with those from the 1998 SENSEVAL
word sense disambiguation exercise and show that
the bigram based decision tree approach is more accurate
than the best SENSEVAL results for 19 of 36
words.
